		    <p>Well, hello again. I didn't think I'd be dusting this project off any time soon. But here's what's got me worked up enough to stop using WordPress: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084884/tumblr-midjourney-openai-training-data-deal-report">Tumblr‚Äôs owner is striking deals with OpenAI and Midjourney for training data, says report</a>.</p>
		    <p>Yeah, real dick move from Automattic. A big enough dick move that I'm reconsidering how I actually publish on the web. Great job.</p>

		    <p>I‚Äôve been working in <a href="https://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> for
			a while now, learning Japanese. Initially, I wanted to do this because
			my son expressed an interest early on in going to see Japan. Now that
			he‚Äôs a bit older, he‚Äôs not as enamored with it. While he may not be
			interested in going, I had decided to try and learn their language.
			Arguably Spanish would be a better fit for the area, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
		    <p>I also had a chance encounter with one of my wife‚Äôs old running
			friends. He lives in Japan with the military and has a Japanese
			girlfriend. They were planning on coming here to meet up with the rest
			of their group, and to visit her daughter, who is getting married.
			Perfect!</p>
		    <p>Well, in theory. In practice, she had <em>much</em> better English
			skills than I could have foreseen, and there was little need to even
			hint at Japanese. Instead, we had a good dinner and talked. My wife‚Äôs
			friend brought my son a bath-time wall scroll that helps children learn
			Hiragana. I have absconded with it in hopes that I can use it to learn
			on my own. Maybe not in the bath. No promises.</p>
		    <p>Back to Duolingo: At first, I was a bit intimidated by the barrier.
			Japanese shares no common root like other so-called ‚Äú<a
										 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages">Romantic
			languages</a>‚Äù, so I had no basis of reference to go by. However, with a
			little bit of goading and some rote memorization of some words, I feel
			like I‚Äôm doing pretty well!</p>
		    <p>Well, until you get to the <em>writing</em> part of it. See, Duolingo
			has all <em>three</em> (yes, three) writing systems as part of it‚Äôs
			Japanese curriculum. While spoken word doesn‚Äôt require much wrangling
			for my brain, the writing <em>does</em>.</p>

		    <p>Hiragana is <em>hard</em>. Well, it‚Äôs hard when you have more than a
			handful of shapes and sounds to associate. I‚Äôve been trying to sort of
			associate the general shape of it with the shape of a roman letter.
			This works okay, but I can only imagine that it's going to get to be too
			much to manage.</p>
		    <p>Still, I'm having a lot of fun doing this and it is
			really interesting to see how such a <em>foreign</em> language works in
			practice.</p>
