				<p>Since I post in page chunks, I was idlying considering a
				method of determining if I needed a JS library (like the ones I
				automatically include). Not that it's massively important, but
				something I was thinking of. Like one does.</p>
				<p>So, my idea works sort of like this:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Load nothing but the bare essentials</li>
					<li>On page "load", check for elements that fit a criteria.
					Namely, elements that likely indicate the need of a module
					or other JavaScript dependency.</li>
					<li>Make a new script element with the corresponding URL to
					the code in it. Then trigger any sort of initialization
					step(s)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>So, something sort of like this:</p>
<pre><code>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
	var footnotes = document.querySelectorAll(".fn");

	if(footnotes.length > 0)
	{
		let options = {
			root: footnotes,
			rootMargin: '10px',
			threshold: 0.5
		}

		let observer = new IntersectionObserver(function(){
			// Do the fetch of the relevant code here
		}, options);
	}
}
</code></pre>
			<p>That way, if you don't need it for something, it doesn't get
			loaded. <del>You could probably marry this with an Intersection
			observer to make it more performant</del> <ins>Changed example to
			include</ins>. Well, it would at least make sense for
			<em>me</em>, because everything is on one page.</p>
			<p>The more likely case is that there is already someone out there
			who not only thought of <em>this</em>, but took it to another level
			and I'm just waaaay behind the current tech.</p>

				<p>Once upon a time, I watched a movie/documentary called <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi">"Jiro
				Dreams of Sushi"</a>, a delightful film about this master sushi
				chef that has a small, but extremely exclusive sushi resturant
				in the bottom of a Tokyo office building. <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Ono_(chef)">Jiro</a>,
				the titular character, is a man driven by the desire to perfect
				his sushi and delight his patrons. Spoilers: He does so.</p>
				<p>Jiro's sushi is served in the style of <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakase">omakase</a>,
				translated as "I'll leave it up to you [the chef]". You don't
				order food like you would at a traditional resturant. You come
				in, sit down and are fed what the chef has in mind for the
				night. Sometimes this is pre-set for a particular season,
				sometimes it changes on the chef's whim or availability of
				ingredients. Regardless, it's a very facinating experience.</p>
				<p>That all being said, <a href="https://www.norikase.com/">my
				wife recently discovered that there is an omakase-style
				resturant in town</a> that is just sort of getting started. It's
				got a small, ten-person seating for the omakase event and she
				got us seats for our anniversary. What a delight it was. I've
				never had sushi like this, nor have I had any sushi that
				compares.</p>

				<p>The interior is very intmate. While they're expanding to take
				up the reminants of the resturant that they moved into, they're
				starting with this and a small outdoor seating area. Very
				cozy.</p>
				<p>The food is prix fixe, meaning you pay first and you get what
				you get. Kind of risky, but if you like sushi, having a master
				chef take you through 17 different courses of deliciousness is
				hard to pass up.</p>

				<p>Seventeen courses. That seems like a lot, thinking about it.
				However, you're eating your meal roughly one bite at a time, so
				it doesn't feel overwhelming. You also get the "show" of seeing
				sushi chefs do what they do best. Hyper-sharp knife skills,
				picky about fish choices and attention to the smallest
				details. It's art.</p>
				<aside><p>Note: these will be unannotated as I don't remotely
				remember what fish or preperation style was used in each.
				Sorry.</p></aside>

				<p>It feels weird to say it, but hover events (mouse style) are
				becoming old fashioned selectors on the web. That's not to say
				that there aren't <em>plenty</em> of users using mouse and
				keyboard on the web. It's just that there are probably <em>many
				more</em> on their phones or tablets, browsing your site. These
				users don't have any standard method of triggering these
				events.</p>
				<p>Just eariler today, I was working on some CSS on my site,
				when I noticed that the hover events don't work well with touch
				screens. I understand <em>why</em>, but the workarounds&hellip;
				don't spark joy. <a
				href="https://git.degruchy.link/ndegruchy/degruchy-org/src/commit/4a7f1d74882727e87574e08476941144636496d2/index.html#L800">One
				I found</a>, a is just a sort of open-ended loaded the
				<code>touchstart</code> event and things ✨ magically ✨
				worked.</p>
				<p>I'm pretty sure that we're not far off from a future where
				hover events are a legacy thing that gets added to tick a box. I
				hope I'm wrong, maybe screens will get a near-touch hover event.
				Who knows...</p>
				<p>For anyone looking to be pendantic, like me, you can wrap
				your <code>:hover</code> psuedo-selectors in a <code>@media
				screen and (hover: hover)</code> to gate the effects behind a
				feature lookup. <b>Note:</b> this appears to be hit-or miss as
				mobile browsers will sometimes fire hover events on hover-esque
				touches. So, <abbr title="Your Milage May Vary">YMMV</abbr>.</p>

				<p>I don't care much for OneNote as a note-taking tool. It works
				alright, but it's slow and often feels sloppy and disorganized.
				I much prefer plain text. It's universal and note prone to
				corruption like the former. So, then why is it so hard to have
				everywhere?</p>
				<h3>Bear</h3>
				<p>What a beautiful app. Too bad it's probably the worst. Not
				only do you pay $1.49/mo. for sync on it's own systems, but you
				don't even get web access for non-Apple platforms. No choice of
				sync to preferred services.</p>
				<h3 id="emacs">Emacs</h3>
				<p>Ah, yes, my favorite editor. Not really something that you
				would call a &quot;markdown&quot; editor, specifically. However,
				it <em>does</em> edit Markdown, and it can save to any location
				the device has access to, including OneDrive or iCloud. There is
				just one problem: No iOS. Not surprising, really, but it makes
				it a shitty cross-platform tool for taking notes.</p>
				<h3 id="byline">Byline</h3>
				<p>Another iOS, Markdown-focused editor. Saves to a number of
				locations, just not OneDrive, not even through the files app.
				While you can <em>access</em> already created notes on it, you
				can&#39;t start them there.</p>
				<h3 id="ios-notes">iOS Notes</h3>
				<p>It saves notes in Exchange Online (or iCloud) and syncs with
				Outlook and kind of OneNote, but not really. Also, very limited
				if you&#39;re not using iCloud as the back-end.</p>
				<h3 id="onenote">OneNote</h3>
				<p>Has decent enough applications for Windows, macOS and iOS
				(and Android), syncs with OneDrive and has connections to notes
				in Exchange Online. Has lots of features and whatnot. It&#39;s
				just slow, clunky and unintuitive and messy and... bleh.</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>Is OneNote really the only answer? 😞</p>

				<p>There are a lot of ways to automate things. PHP has,
				<a href="https://wordpress.org" rel="nofollow">historically</a>,
				been very good at making HTML templated things like blogs. Even
				as it has expanded in purpose with command-line utility, it
				still does and amazing job at sticking content in HTML and
				sending that to a browser.</p>
				<p>So seductive is this ability to make content appear in HTML
				that even stupidly trivial things, like this page, whisper their
				almost silent promises of making it <em>so much</em> easier to
				write and publish on it. Thankfully, this has already been done
				to death by a dearth of links to abandoned PHP projects smeared
				across the gleaming black and white surface of GitHub's project
				listings pages.</p>
				<p>Would I like to make this whole process easier? <em>Of course
				I would.</em> That's not the point, though.</p>
				<p>I <em>could</em> implement a PHP page to iterate through a
				directory of Markdown files and render them unto this page. I
				<em>could</em> have a PHP powered image pipeline to crop, slice,
				dice and thumbnailize images included on the page. I'm fairly
				sure I could even <em>create</em> those things myself.</p>
				<p>I don't like that, though. It feels cheap. It feels &hellip;
				sterile and formless. I don't <em>want</em> that because I'm
				tired of managing <em>that</em>. The workflows, the process,
				making sure things go right. Setting up infrastructure on my
				laptop to make sure that the code I'm pushing doesn't break on
				the server.</p>
				<p><em>Feh!</em></p>
				<p>I have a preview function in VSCode, and even if I didn't,
				the dwindling number of browsers out there would be more than
				sufficient for the task.</p>
				<p>I'm not above a certain level of irony and dissonance. I
				<em>know</em> that VSCode is basically a hyper-fancy webpage for
				writing code. I <em>know</em> that most applications I use are
				just webpages guissied up and mangled beyond their original
				intents. But this is <em>my</em> site, and <em>I</em> get to
				make the rules.</p>

						Fear of missing out (FOMO) is the feeling of
						apprehension that one is either not in the know or
						missing out on information, events, experiences, or life
						decisions that could make one's life better. FOMO is
						also associated with a fear of regret, which may lead
						to concerns that one might miss an opportunity for
						social interaction, a novel experience, a memorable
						event, or a profitable investment.

				<p><a href="#20220309-antisocial">I have a problem with Social
				Media.</a> It stems from my underlying depression. With social
				media, I can create a persona that is similar to me, but is
				designed to be a much more symapathetic overview. To what end?
				More interaction.</p>
				<p>The more replies, likes, boosts and other buttons, the more
				my head gets a tiny little dopamine kick. String those along for
				enough time and it becomes habit. The problem with this, though,
				is that while dopamine is all well and good. It doesn't keep you
				coming back. That's where FOMO comes into play.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>"A challenge is that the part of our brain that
					reinforces behaviors is stimulated by novelty; social media
					scrolling always promises something new with the next
					scroll."</p>
					<cite>Dr. Michael Jaffee, director of the Neurology Sleep
					Clinic at the University of Florida</cite>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Forget drugs! Scrolling Reddit, Twitter or Mastodon allows
				you to get that "just <em>one</em> more" satisfaction.
				Infinitely. That makes it not only hard to quit, full stop, but
				also hard to just put down.</p>
				<p>For me, it wasn't something I could handle responsibly. I
				tried, like the author, to do things like:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>While app developers want to keep you engaged for as long
					as possible, most of them do offer tools to limit screen
					use. So I did what I don't think (anecdotally) many people
					do — I set up time limits on my social media apps like
					Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to help manage my screen use
					before bed with the hopes of getting more sleep.</p>
					<p>&hellip;</p>
					<p>Sometimes it worked and I would surrender my phone to my
					bedside table, irritated but also appreciative of the sweet
					relief of darkness on my eyes. But other times I would plug
					in the passcode, ignoring the tinge of regret that pinched
					my stomach and knowledge that my future self would be angry
					— and tired — in the morning.</p>
					<cite>Katie Camero, BuzzFeed News Reporter</cite>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Only to ignore the rules I had set for myself and just plow
				on, unhindered. It was really surreal the first few times, and
				pretty much automatic by the time I had my blow up. For me, the
				problem wasn't lack of sleep. It was the crumbling relationships
				I had ignored for too long. Worse than being tired or cranky, I
				had to deal with real human issues around my additction. I still
				do.</p>
				<p>I feel it still. The need to post pithy little comments.
				Engage in conversation and insider's humor. Every time, though,
				I need to understand that it's not <em>that</em> important.
				Especially it's not important enough to interrupt family time,
				or other important events, where I should be present.</p>
				<p>To that end, I am seeking professional help for my addiction.
				I know I need help, and now I'm going to get it. Maybe one day
				I'll be in control enough to re-engage with social media, but my
				suspicion is that I am going to have to treat this like
				Alcoholism and just abstain.</p>

				<p>I've been using social media a <em>lot</em>. My drug of
				choice is the federated system known as Mastodon. It's an
				ad-free, user supported system of services that have no one
				central point of control or failure. This means you can chat
				with all kinds of people on all kinds of wacky subjects.</p>
				<p>That's kind of the problem.</p>
				<p>I've been using it as a substitute for my own life. I've used
				it in ways that have hurt others, but mostly I've used it for
				the minimal dopamine kick that you get when someone does &hellip;
				whatever, respond, like &hellip; etc. Small kicks frequently enough
				over time make you feel good, in control and liked. Regardless
				of the actual state of things.</p>
				<p>Destroying my life for a dopamine kick isn't exactly
				sustainable. Hence, my abstinence.</p>
				<p>To help fill that void, I've decided that I want to journal
				more. I got a book and a pen and I've been writing. I also have
				this blog to help me with that. Despite my misgivings around
				WordPress, I've tabled them until I can get my head and life
				straightened out.</p>
				<p>I'm going to take this opportunity to take a good hard look
				at myself and what I get out of the tools and systems I use. I
				want to be enriched by things, not dragged into small highs that
				I seek more and more of to the detriment of everything else.</p>
				<p>So, if you're looking for me. I'm here, just not there.</p>

				<p>I used to like WordPress. Back when it was just a naicent
					blogging platform with spaghetti code PHP and an friendly
					interface.</p>
				<p>However, it's turned into a monster. A monster that wants to
					be everything to everyone without actually fixing anything. This
					feels dangerous, as it doesn't feel like anything substantial is
					being done to help ensure that the codebase is more organized or
					easier to interface with. Instead they add features, like
					Gutenberg, and press the "advantages" of "Full Site Editing".
					Throwing the theme world on it's head, pushing more and more
					features into JavaScript instead of using the proper tooling
					already installed on the server. They push more WooCommerce
					plugins and online store updates to monitize and drive
					"engagement" and "click throughs" and "sales".</p>
				<p>I want the <em>old</em> WordPress back. The one that was
					designed to be a blogging platform. It filled a niche that was
					needed, and left the more generic Content Management to the
					heavy-hitters like Joomla and Drupal. You can see the fragments
					of the fevered development in where they put things in the
					database. Tables once only intending to hold one type of content
					now layer lots of different options and configurations in a
					haphazard manner. Things like theme customizations appearing in
					the post content tables along side block customizations. Term
					tables house post content information. It's chaos.</p>
				<p>So, for now, I'm back to hand-editing this content, in a text
					editor and uploading it to my server and serving it statically.
					No content management system like Hugo, no PHP or Laravel or
					Node.js. Just me, an editor and a bit of time. I'm sure a time
					will come where I migrate to (or back to) something. Right now,
					I'm just enjoying the feeling.</p>
