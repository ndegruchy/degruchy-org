					<p>I‚Äôve been working in <a href="https://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> for
					a while now, learning Japanese. Initially, I wanted to do this because
					my son expressed an interest early on in going to see Japan. Now that
					he‚Äôs a bit older, he‚Äôs not as enamored with it. While he may not be
					interested in going, I had decided to try and learn their language.
					Arguably Spanish would be a better fit for the area, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
					<p>I also had a chance encounter with one of my wife‚Äôs old running
					friends. He lives in Japan with the military and has a Japanese
					girlfriend. They were planning on coming here to meet up with the rest
					of their group, and to visit her daughter, who is getting married.
					Perfect!</p>
					<p>Well, in theory. In practice, she had <em>much</em> better English
					skills than I could have foreseen, and there was little need to even
					hint at Japanese. Instead, we had a good dinner and talked. My wife‚Äôs
					friend brought my son a bath-time wall scroll that helps children learn
					Hiragana. I have absconded with it in hopes that I can use it to learn
					on my own. Maybe not in the bath. No promises.</p>
					<p>Back to Duolingo: At first, I was a bit intimidated by the barrier.
					Japanese shares no common root like other so-called ‚Äú<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages">Romantic
					languages</a>‚Äù, so I had no basis of reference to go by. However, with a
					little bit of goading and some rote memorization of some words, I feel
					like I‚Äôm doing pretty well!</p>
					<p>Well, until you get to the <em>writing</em> part of it. See, Duolingo
					has all <em>three</em> (yes, three) writing systems as part of it‚Äôs
					Japanese curriculum. While spoken word doesn‚Äôt require much wrangling
					for my brain, the writing <em>does</em>.</p>

					<p>Hiragana is <em>hard</em>. Well, it‚Äôs hard when you have more than a
					handful of shapes and sounds to associate. I‚Äôve been trying to sort of
					associate the general shape of it with the shape of a roman letter.
					This works okay, but I can only imagine that it's going to get to be too
					much to manage.</p>
					<p>Still, I'm having a lot of fun doing this and it is
					really interesting to see how such a <em>foreign</em> language works in
					practice.</p>
