							F.O.M.O. or "The Fear of Missing Out"
						</a>

					<dd>
						Fear of missing out (FOMO) is the feeling of
						apprehension that one is either not in the know or
						missing out on information, events, experiences, or life
						decisions that could make one's life better. FOMO is
						also associated with a fear of regret, which may lead
						to concerns that one might miss an opportunity for
						social interaction, a novel experience, a memorable
						event, or a profitable investment.
					</dd>
				</dl>
				<p><a href="#20220309-antisocial">I have a problem with Social
				Media.</a> It stems from my underlying depression. With social
				media, I can create a persona that is similar to me, but is
				designed to be a much more symapathetic overview. To what end?
				More interaction.</p>
				<p>The more replies, likes, boosts and other buttons, the more
				my head gets a tiny little dopamine kick. String those along for
				enough time and it becomes habit. The problem with this, though,
				is that while dopamine is all well and good. It doesn't keep you
				coming back. That's where FOMO comes into play.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>"A challenge is that the part of our brain that
					reinforces behaviors is stimulated by novelty; social media
					scrolling always promises something new with the next
					scroll."</p>
					<cite>Dr. Michael Jaffee, director of the Neurology Sleep
					Clinic at the University of Florida</cite>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Forget drugs! Scrolling Reddit, Twitter or Mastodon allows
				you to get that "just <em>one</em> more" satisfaction.
				Infinitely. That makes it not only hard to quit, full stop, but
				also hard to just put down.</p>
				<p>For me, it wasn't something I could handle responsibly. I
				tried, like the author, to do things like:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>While app developers want to keep you engaged for as long
					as possible, most of them do offer tools to limit screen
					use. So I did what I don't think (anecdotally) many people
					do — I set up time limits on my social media apps like
					Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to help manage my screen use
					before bed with the hopes of getting more sleep.</p>
					<p>&hellip;</p>
					<p>Sometimes it worked and I would surrender my phone to my
					bedside table, irritated but also appreciative of the sweet
					relief of darkness on my eyes. But other times I would plug
					in the passcode, ignoring the tinge of regret that pinched
					my stomach and knowledge that my future self would be angry
					— and tired — in the morning.</p>
					<cite>Katie Camero, BuzzFeed News Reporter</cite>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Only to ignore the rules I had set for myself and just plow
				on, unhindered. It was really surreal the first few times, and
				pretty much automatic by the time I had my blow up. For me, the
				problem wasn't lack of sleep. It was the crumbling relationships
				I had ignored for too long. Worse than being tired or cranky, I
				had to deal with real human issues around my additction. I still
				do.</p>
				<p>I feel it still. The need to post pithy little comments.
				Engage in conversation and insider's humor. Every time, though,
				I need to understand that it's not <em>that</em> important.
				Especially it's not important enough to interrupt family time,
				or other important events, where I should be present.</p>
				<p>To that end, I am seeking professional help for my addiction.
				I know I need help, and now I'm going to get it. Maybe one day
				I'll be in control enough to re-engage with social media, but my
				suspicion is that I am going to have to treat this like
				Alcoholism and just abstain.</p>

				<p>I've been using social media a <em>lot</em>. My drug of
				choice is the federated system known as Mastodon. It's an
				ad-free, user supported system of services that have no one
				central point of control or failure. This means you can chat
				with all kinds of people on all kinds of wacky subjects.</p>
				<p>That's kind of the problem.</p>
				<p>I've been using it as a substitute for my own life. I've used
				it in ways that have hurt others, but mostly I've used it for
				the minimal dopamine kick that you get when someone does &hellip;
				whatever, respond, like &hellip; etc. Small kicks frequently enough
				over time make you feel good, in control and liked. Regardless
				of the actual state of things.</p>
				<p>Destroying my life for a dopamine kick isn't exactly
				sustainable. Hence, my abstinence.</p>
				<p>To help fill that void, I've decided that I want to journal
				more. I got a book and a pen and I've been writing. I also have
				this blog to help me with that. Despite my misgivings around
				WordPress, I've tabled them until I can get my head and life
				straightened out.</p>
				<p>I'm going to take this opportunity to take a good hard look
				at myself and what I get out of the tools and systems I use. I
				want to be enriched by things, not dragged into small highs that
				I seek more and more of to the detriment of everything else.</p>
				<p>So, if you're looking for me. I'm here, just not there.</p>

				<p>I used to like WordPress. Back when it was just a naicent
					blogging platform with spaghetti code PHP and an friendly
					interface.</p>
				<p>However, it's turned into a monster. A monster that wants to
					be everything to everyone without actually fixing anything. This
					feels dangerous, as it doesn't feel like anything substantial is
					being done to help ensure that the codebase is more organized or
					easier to interface with. Instead they add features, like
					Gutenberg, and press the "advantages" of "Full Site Editing".
					Throwing the theme world on it's head, pushing more and more
					features into JavaScript instead of using the proper tooling
					already installed on the server. They push more WooCommerce
					plugins and online store updates to monitize and drive
					"engagement" and "click throughs" and "sales".</p>
				<p>I want the <em>old</em> WordPress back. The one that was
					designed to be a blogging platform. It filled a niche that was
					needed, and left the more generic Content Management to the
					heavy-hitters like Joomla and Drupal. You can see the fragments
					of the fevered development in where they put things in the
					database. Tables once only intending to hold one type of content
					now layer lots of different options and configurations in a
					haphazard manner. Things like theme customizations appearing in
					the post content tables along side block customizations. Term
					tables house post content information. It's chaos.</p>
				<p>So, for now, I'm back to hand-editing this content, in a text
					editor and uploading it to my server and serving it statically.
					No content management system like Hugo, no PHP or Laravel or
					Node.js. Just me, an editor and a bit of time. I'm sure a time
					will come where I migrate to (or back to) something. Right now,
					I'm just enjoying the feeling.</p>
