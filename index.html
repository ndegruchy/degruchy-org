					<p>While GNU Readline may not be <em>Emacs
					Proper</em>, it does share a lot of history. The
					default keybindings mirror many of Emacs
					keybindings, and even the settings are "kebab
					case", just like in Emacs, albeit not in
					Elisp.</p>
					<p>I recently discovered that there are some
					really nice settings you can set to have your
					Readline be a bit more comfy. Not sure why these
					aren't default, but whatever. They'll work in
					Bash, but ZSH and other shells might not implement
					them. So, <abbr title="Your Milage May Vary">YMMV</abbr>.</p>
					<pre>
						<code>
## File: ~/.inputrc
# Make autocompletion case insensitive and display suggestions after single tab.
set completion-ignore-case On
set show-all-if-ambiguous On
# Show color in completions
set colored-completion-prefix On
set colored-stats On
						</code>
					</pre>
					<p>I love finding out about stuff like this,
					because it makes me happy to discover a part of
					the tooling I wasn't using before, but actually
					wanted. It's like getting a Christmas gift that
					you want, but hadn't asked for yet.</p>

					<p>So, one of the things I had to sort out when
						slimming down on the amount of external packages
						that I use is to get things installed
						without <code>use-package</code>. Typically, I
						used a form that looked a lot like this:</p>
					<pre>
						<code>
(unless (package-installed-p 'package)
	(package-refresh-contents)
	(package-install 'package))
						</code>
					</pre>
					<p>For a small amount of packages, this was fine,
						even if it was inefficient by refreshing the
						package contents for each instance of that. It was
						barely a problem with 1 or 2 packages.</p>
					<p><em>Of course</em>, there is a much more
						efficient manner, already built into Emacs, and
						much easier to implement:</p>
					<pre>
						<code>
(setq package-selected-packages '(ef-themes emms))
(package-install-selected-packages)
						</code>
					</pre>
					<p>Yeah. So, just make a list of package names you
						want to install and uh, tell it to do that. No
						multiple refreshes, just here's what I want, go do
						that. Magic.</p>

					<p>One of the things that I've been working on
						since my parents moved down is to go through all
						of my old crap that they saved for years. Some of
						it's old Comic Books, some are various collections
						of old cards, some are just toys and do-dads.
						However, it seems as though I had <em>quite</em>
						the collection of Nintendo (NES) Games.</p>
					<p>Additionally, my wife's parent's <em>also</em>
						saved their NES stuff from 30 years ago. These
						collections, combined, are pretty formidable, and
						are in generally very good condition. As it turns
						out, also worth a decent chunk of change. While
						not <em>life-altering</em>, they amount to enough
						to have to report to the IRS as earned income.
						Which is hilarious.</p>
					<p>It's nice to see that collectors of fine old
						Nintendo games are still around, looking for nice
						additions to their collections. While not
						everything is an amazing seller, the ones that
						have sold well surprised me. Games like
						Ghostbusters; Which I never could get the hang of
						as a kid, and Metroid, which confused me. Both did
						well.</p>
					<p>I also discovered some games that I didn't
						realize existed, things like stand-alone Duck Hunt
						and Super Mario Bros being chief among them. While
						I guess I shouldn't be <em>surprised</em> that
						there were stand alone versions of these games, I
						guess I was just familiar with the more common
						combo versions of the games. It's been one
						profitable nostalgia trip.</p>
					<p>I've also learned a bit about how eBay
						operates, and how they make their money. It's a
						pretty neat idea, one I'm surprised didn't take
						longer to catch on.</p>

					<p>Recently, I was given an Android phone (Samsung S22) as a
						work device to help us learn and cope with the uptick in
						Android device orders from within our organization. Having
						spent at least a week with it, here are my initial
						thoughts:</p>
					<h2>Build</h2>
					<p>The device is built very well. The buttons feel firm, the
						screen, sides and back all are constructed with nice metal
						parts and even the camera housing, large as it is, is well
						constructed. If I were to switch, personally, this phone
						would be a good device from a <em>quality feel</em>
						perspective.</p>
					<p>The interesting changes from the iOS devices I'm used to
						are the small pip of a forward facing camera (instead of the
						'notch' or 'dyanamic island'). Additionally, they
						doubled-down on the available authentication mechanisms. You
						can set PIN/passwords like usual, but there is also a facial
						recognition feature <em>and</em> a hidden finger print
						reader <em>behind</em> the glass. Neat &#x1F4F8;</p>
					<h2>Software</h2>
					<p>It's pretty, but man you are asked to sign in to
						<em>everything</em>, moreover, you are asked to allow
						permissions for <em>everything</em> apps that don't even
						seem like should have access to <em>making phone calls</em>,
						ask for the permission anyway. Not to mention, you can't
						remove many different apps, only disable some. While the UI
						is very pretty and "bouncy", I feel like I'm being asked for
						all of my personal information. From multiple sources! In
						addition to Google asking for a login (normal), Samsung asks
						for an account for various "backup" apps and other bits and
						bobs, then <em>Verizon</em> asks for login informaiton for
						<em>its</em> apps.
					</p>
					<p>Google would have been enough, but every single app has
						it's hand out for your personal information. This, alone,
						makes me feel ill at ease when working on it. Despite flashy
						graphics and fun animations, neat integrations and features.
						It's a machine designed to suck the maximum value out of
						your personal data.</p>

					<p>Not intentionally, of course, but it does go to
						emphasize the fact that I can <em>feel</em> when
						I'm off them. It's like the negative voice inside
						your head suddenly gets louder, and you lose the
						ability to ignore it.</p>
					<p>I don't like taking medication. Not that the
						alternative is any better, but it just makes me
						feel so <em>old</em>. That's not to say that
						I'm <em>not</em> old. I am. It just makes me feel
						older than I am. That, <em>also</em>, doesn't
						help the situation.</p>
					<p>It doesn't help that the Holiday Madness&trade;
						is gearing up. With the addition of my parents
						being in town now, we have all new complex
						schedules to work out. I'm sure things will settle
						out into a happy equilibrium, but I find myself
						less and less interested in anything not a few
						specific things. I find myself repeating the
						mantra "Leave me alone," which is concerning,
						since I only want that when I'm in a depressive
						episode.</p>
					<p>So, how do I fix it? I dunno. I'm going to
						spend some time with my family this weekend, so
						hopefully that'll help.</p>

					<p>I find it very tempting to write about current
						events. It's an easy task, there is often plenty
						of information already gathered for me, and most
						people have an idea of who the principal actors
						are. All I have to do is plug some words in to my
						computer and out comes something that
						everyone<sup>1</sup> can read with little-to-no
						exposition required.</p>
					<p>That's kind of the problem: It's crap. There's
						no nuance to it. I often look at places like
						Hacker News and Reddit where I discover a site
						where someone has crafted a well-laid-out document
						that, even if I don't agree with it, I can
						follow.</p>
					<p>I'd like to write more for writing's sake.
						Though, that's what leads me to the title of this
						post. If I cut out stupid current events and Emacs
						posts, I think I've cut my list of topics down to
						a vanishingly small number. I mean,
						I <em>could</em> write about my life. Not sure I'm

					<p>Emacs packages are all well good. There are
						lots of tools to allow you to extend Emacs in ways
						that were likely never imagined when it was
						created (<em>checks notes&hellip;</em> <strong>46
							years ago</strong>). Some of these are
						tremendously useful, worthy of inclusion into
						Emacs proper. Some are just utilities to make a
						particular task easier or smooth over a rough
						edge.</p>
					<p>I, however, I don't use many of those things. I
						don't program anymore, and many of those utility
						packages just sort of paper over some
						functionality that I could likely just figure out
						on my own, or eschew altogether. To that end, I've
						been stripping out parts of my Emacs configuration
						or rewriting it to not require things
						like <code>use-package</code> or writing more
						functions that do similar functionality. One big
						thing is investigating the inner workings of the
						core distribution of Emacs. Just like I've been
						doing some archaeology in previous posts, I've
						been putting some of the things I've discovered to
						use. Things like configuring <code>ibuffer</code>
						to have custom categories, or
						attaching <code>hl-line</code> to make
						navigating <code>dired</code>-like buffers easier
						instead of using something like <code>lin</code>.
						It's been a journey, and a learning experience,
						but I think I'm more in tune with how to use Emacs
						more effectively, even with those
						enhancements.</p>

					<p>Man, it's fun to look at metrics. It lets you
						know that you're doing well (or not) and how you
						might be able to improve. These improvements
						usually help ensure your visitors get excellent
						experiences when visiting your site. Except for
						me, because I don't run a big website with
						complicated parts and massive payloads with CDNs
						and megabytes of JavaScript. I have a single HTML
						page with some external images (hosted here) and a
						very small CSS file, a tiny amount of
						non-essential javascript tops it all off.</p>
					<p>Which is why stuff like this makes me feel like
						the whole thing is just more of that synthetic
						benchmark bullshit that we get fed for every other
						thing we try and compare.</p>

					<p>I come across news about the "Fediverse" from
						time-to-time, while not being involved in it
						anymore. At various points in my past, I was
						trying to map my blog onto the mechanisms that run
						that system, as well as be a good "IndieWeb"
						citizen. Back then, I was using tooling that
						wasn't quite there yet. Trying to map tooling like
						WordPress into paradigms that it wasn't really
						designed (at the core) to handle seems to be the
						favorite past-time of web-developers. I also was
						looking at dedicated platforms, like micro.blog
						and Known. Those are good in their own right. Just
						not for me.</p>
					<p>Today I came across a couple more dedicated
						packages for being both personal microblog
						services, <em>and</em> good IndieWeb citizens.
						Microblog.pub and Akkoma. Great ideas for ensuring
						that your content hits the widest community it
						can, and provides nice feedback and other "cool
						social" stuff, like "likes, favorites and
						reblogs". It's really a tempting time to spin up
						something and see if things have improved over the
						time I've been absent from the space.</p>
					<p>That's the thing, though. I don't <em>need</em>
						those things. I don't <em>want</em> the hassle of
						managing postgres, or python, or elixr or any of
						the other components required to bundle something
						that I likely won't get any use out of anyway. I
						already <em>know</em> that no one will use it,
						that I won't like managing it and that it'll all
						end in frustration. I'm trying not to be that guy
						anymore. I just want to slam some text into a
						document and save it. Until I find some growing
						pain that I can't fix, this is all I need.</p>

					<p>Recently, there has been some issues with my
						server. I keep running into an OOM killed set of
						processes for <code>redis</code> and possibly
						other applications, causing things to stall out
						and make the server slow or unresponsive. I've
						disabled the services, and I'm beginning to rethink
						hosting my stuff on a VPS. I <em>used</em> host my
						site on Amazon AWS CloudFront (static assets are
						relatively easy to push entirely to endpoints).
						However, I got the bug to host my own stuff, like
						Miniflux and Gitea, a choice that I'm wondering if
						was worth it. Right now I spend ~$5 for the VPS
						alone (not including domain and DNS). I don't
						really <em>need</em> to host any of these. Github
						is sufficient for my code, and Miniflux has a
						cheap-as-all-get-out service that I could just
						plug into and go. I would only lose a server I
						have to properly secure and SSH access.</p>

						Emacs Selection Woes

				<section>
					<p>Yeah, another post today. How about that?</p>
					<p>So, Emacs has an interesting problem. Selecting
						things is... unintuitive and often just wrong. For
						example, in a stock Emacs system, pressing
						<code>M-@</code> (Alt-Shift-2) will run
						<code>mark-word</code>. This should do what you
						think it does: Mark/select a word in highlighting
						so that you can modify it somehow. However, if
						you're not at the <em>beginning</em> of that word,
						then <code>mark-word</code> does <em>not</em> do
						what you might believe. In fact, all it does is
						highlight to the end of that word, leaving any
						other letters before the point just sort of
						hanging out there.
					</p>
					<p>Now, there are methods of fixing this in elisp.
						As a matter of fact, there is an excellent package
						called <code>expand-region</code> that
						intelligently expands a selection, moving outward
						(or inward) as you repeat the command. That's kind
						of the problem, though. I shouldn't <em>need</em>
						an external package to do stuff like "selecting
						text between quotes" or "selecting text inside
						a function". Emacs is smart and has been around
						for 40(?) years! This should be a solved problem
						by now.</p>
					<p>Of course it is. Well, not really, but there
						are some built-in tools that don't work really
						well. Mainly, selecting objects can be done with
						some wrapping around <code>thing-at-point</code>,
						which gives you information around what the cursor
						is on. This would allow you to write code to then
						add a mark to the extents of that object, and even
						move outward, as <code>expand-region</code>
						does.</p>
					<p>To that end, <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/thing-cmds.el">Drew
							Adams created an elisp library that does... some of
							that</a>. It certainly wraps the
						<code>thing-at-point</code> code well enough that
						it can be used by a mere mortal. However, the
						functionality is lacking. If I want to select
						successive words, I can cycle through the
						selection objects, but none of them usually fit.
						I, more often than not, end up having to wrangle
						some part of it with manual movement
						adjustments.
					</p>
					<p>Maybe I'm just pampered by the idea that
						<code>expand-region</code> is <em>so close</em> to
						the solution that I'd like, that not having the
						building blocks to begin with is frustrating.
						Especially since I'm finding <em>so much</em> of
						Emacs built-in functionality has my needs covered
						nicely.

					<p>This probably sits loosely in the category of
						"archeology". <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Imenu.html">IMenu</a>
						is a tool that allows you to find major sections
						of a buffer by name. For example, in this HTML
						document, if I were to run <code>M-x imenu</code>,
						I would get a listing of all the headline tags
						(<code>H1</code> through <code>H6</code>) that I
						could use to quickly jump to that area. Very
						useful.</p>
					<p><code>Imenu</code> seems like something that
						would be awesome if it were better exposed. Much
						like the other tools that I've explored, there are
						countless gems in Emacs that get recreated because
						of their lack of exposure, or poor naming.</p>
					<p>I <em>am</em> glad to have
						found <code>Imenu</code> though. It seems like
						a <em>very</em> useful tool to jump around without
						having to find another package,
						like <code>ace-jump</code> or similar. While it
						may not do everything that those packages can do
						(<a href="https://xenodium.com/imenu-on-emacs-eshell/">it
							can be extended</a>, though), I would wager that
						jumping around is generally more useful around
						major sections, versus "locally". I don't know, I
						don't code anymore.</p>

					<p>Another article about disused Emacs features
						that I likely won't use? Youbetcha!</p>
					<p>Today's bit of archaeology is
						<code>rec-mode</code>. It's a mode that is meant
						to be used in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/recutils/">GNU
							Recutils package</a>. These tools generate,
						maintain and operate on plain-text database of
						<em>records</em>. These can be used for a wide
						variety of data, from loaned books, to movies
						watched to <a href="https://git.gnunet.org/gana.git/tree/gnu-name-system-record-types/registry.rec">a
							sort of DNS-esque database for GNUNet</a>. Handy
						stuff. In Emacs, this functionality is exposed
						when you open a file with the extension of
						<code>.rec</code>. By default, you get a read-only
						<code>narrow'd</code> view of records that you can
						page through and manipulate. Typically, you're
						supposed to use the command-line tool
						<code>recins</code> to add items (so that the data
						integrity can be maintained), but of course Emacs
						can edit that buffer, as well.
					</p>
					<p>I am, proverbially, kicking the tires on this
						mode by making a simple address book that can be
						queried for things like email addresses, names and
						phone numbers. The nice thing about this that
						<em>it's just text</em>. I can manipulate it,
						compress it, encrypt it, slice it, dice it and
						even store it in a version control system like
						<code>git</code>. I don't have to worry about the
						format going out-of-date, or not being able to
						read it in the future. Again, <em>it's just
							text</em>. Obviously, there are some downsides. A
						lot of downsides, actually. It's really a nice
						solution, though.
					</p>
					<p><code>rec-mode</code> has some nice features.
						You can query the database and get information
						about the contents, right inside Emacs. There is a
						lot of nice features and because it's text, and
						because the features use standard lisp functions,
						you can integrate it with all sorts of other Emacs
						tooling. Even <code>org-mode</code> has query
						support to look up data in your database(s).</p>
					<p>While there are some rough edges with editing
						things, and I had to come up with my own skeletons
						for adding new records, I feel like there is a lot
						that can be done with this tool.</p>

					<p>I dunno. I am tired. I can't quite place my

						news out there that makes it hard to empathize,
						lest I burn out that way, too. Spending a bunch of
						money on appliances at home, because after roughly
						sixteen years, they're finally failing. My wife is
						stressed, which makes me stressed, which makes my
						son upset.</p>
					<p>My parents are finally moved down, but they
						have their own issues. Trying to get them
						integrated with the way things "work" down here.
						That's causing some friction and
						misunderstandings. Plus, lots of extra work and
						moving stuff. I wish I had the focus and
						wherewithal to implement the things I think I
						<em>want</em>, but I lack the planning or
						understanding to properly implement them without a
						flaming mess on my hands.
					</p>
					<p>I feel tired because I see all of this
						<em>stuff</em> and I'm indecisive enough to not
						know what I <em>want</em> from what looks cool at
						the time. On top of that, I have a limited budget.
						So, often, I think "my eyes are bigger than my
						stomach", when it comes to implementing things. I
						know my family isn't going to care one whit about
						using Jabber or SIP/Asterisk or track their
						contacts in Monica, or do bills and other stuff in
						Firefly. They have their own little things they do
						and use, and they leave me to play in my own
						sandbox, alone.
					</p>
					<p>I guess I should just embrace it and either do

					<p>So, Apple's iOS 16 and watchOS 9 just released
						yesterday. While there isn't much but bling to
						note, one of the useful features I found out about
						was a medicine tracker. This feature allows you to
						set up a schedule for your medications and reminds
						you when to take them. While I used to use a
						calendar entry for this, I can now clear off those
						annoying clutter entries for something more direct
						and useful. The feature will even log when you've
						taken them, so you can remember what you've had
						and what you've missed -- something a calendar
						entry can't do.</p>
					<p>With this entry and some other health-related
						items, I can see Apple devices being the go-to for
						medically and health conscious consumers. While
						many of these features are not "sexy", they're
						really helpful and something that actually add
						value over the more cosmetic changes that everyone
						seems to give more attention to.</p>

					<p>Certainly, you never expect your own actions to
						come back to haunt you, when you have a child.
						Much less see the bad behaviors you sometimes
						exhibit reflected so <em>clearly</em> in their own
						behaviors. It's heartbreaking. Especially when
						those behaviors are something you're trying to
						work on yourself. Fitting, as it may be, it is a
						bitter reminder that children are absolute
						<em>sponges</em> when it comes to information and
						acceptable behavior.
					</p>
					<p>I am currently reaping that with my own son,
						with his addiction to screens, to the point that
						he ignores fun and exciting things that we want to
						do with him over the immediate gratification with
						his own game or whatever. <em>I</em> did this. I
						know it. I don't have to search my feelings or
						understand myself any better to know that what I'm
						seeing is the product of my own bad behavior
						reflected back on me. It hurts. I know it's
						something I must accept, though. I have to work on

					<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Image_002dDired.html"><code>image-dired</code></a>
						is not a new tool to me, I have been aware of it
						for some time now. It has always proven as a sort
						of suboptimal image browser to me. However, it
						seems I've "Been Using it Wrong"&trade; this whole
						time. You can use <code>dired</code> to mark images,
						then <code>image-dired-display-thumbs</code> to
						generate a new buffer with their thumbnails. Neat!
						I had frequently been using the bare
						<code>image-dired</code> command, which did
						<em>all</em> of the images in a buffer.
					</p>
					<p>I, also, didn't know that <code>image-dired</code>
						could tag photos and keep them in a separate
						database. What a neat idea, one I could see
						working for a small collection of photos and
						images.</p>
					<p>I keep finding these little tools. In addition
						to these little internal pieces, Emacs has such a
						delightful amount of customization that tools
						practically write themselves:</p>
					<pre>
						<code>
(defun sentin/break ()
"Break a sentence out and work it in a new buffer."
  (interactive)
  (backward-sentence)
  (kill-sentence)
  (switch-to-buffer-other-window "*sent-breakt*")
  (erase-buffer)
  (yank))

(defun sentin/choose ()
  "Choose a sentence and go back to the other window."
  (interactive)
  (backward-sentence)
  (kill-sentence)
  (other-window 1)
  (kill-buffer "*sent-breakt*")
  (yank)
  (delete-other-windows))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
					<p>Little tools like that allow you to sculpt
						Emacs into not just a programmer's text editor.
						You can make it your writing swiss-army-knife, or
						your tool for operating on remote machines, or
						your email platform, or even your music and
						chatting tool with <code>emms</code> and
						<code>circe</code>. As long as the information can be
						processed as text, then Emacs can be sculpted to
						work with it.

					<p>She-Hulk is amazing. Marvel fans? Eh. Many of
						them are worse than some villains. I say
						that because <em>every</em> new episode of any
						show (<em>especially</em> ones with female leads),
						gets picked apart on an atomic scale. Sure, there
						are lots of different Easter eggs and nods to
						other shows/movies, and it feels fantastic when you
						notice them, but the people producing these shows
						are also human. Some mistakes or mix-ups are going
						to happen. However, the biggest criticisms seem to
						be about the female leads themselves.</p>
					<p>I find this particular point exhausting and
						disheartening. Are so many men <em>that</em>
						insecure that they can't enjoy something if
						they're not <em>explicitly</em> represented as the
						lead role? They seem to posess an ego so fragile
						that it seems like the mere idea of there being a
						strong female lead (good or bad) is enough to draw
						more than their fair share of ire. At least
						they're posting them where we can see them and
						shame them.</p>
					<p>I, for one, am enjoying this sort of&hellip;
						"girl power" moment going on in the <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr>. It
						not only provides more insight into the mind of
						the characters and what they go through, but it
						also makes you realize just how much shit the
						average woman has to go through just to
						<em>exist</em>. Let alone what a super-powered
						woman has to endure.
					</p>
					<p>So, bring it on, Marvel. I know that She-Hulk
						is leaning in to poking the haters, but let's see
						some more powerful women on the screen. Let's give
						everyone some heroes to root for, because that is
						what these sort of stories provide. Give people
						something to rally around.</p>

					<p>As this blog gets longer, the larger the
						temptation of using some sort of organizational
						system looms large. Using Emacs, <code>org-mode</code>
						is a natural draw. It's integrated with Emacs, can
						be used for all manner of things, and has a
						handy/clean export feature that can generate whole
						projects of marked up content. Almost tailor-made,
						if you're looking to stay within Emacs.</p>
					<p>I think there is some friction for me, due to
						the way that I'd have to rewrite some of my posts
						with some sort of sensible markup for galleries,
						and the fact that I'd have to continually add
						things like properties to ensure ID's don't get
						broken and much, much more. The list of items is
						daunting. I also don't really look forward to
						migrating to something else, like Hugo or Jekyll
						or even WordPress, as they have their own overhead
						and migration issues to deal with.</p>
					<p>I feel like I've trod this line of thinking
						before. A good takeaway is that other
						systems <em>seem</em> nicer, they have their own
						problems to deal with.</p>

					<p>For this site, making image thumbnails is not
						an automated process. Generally, it looks like
						this:</p>
					<p><code>fdfind -e jpg -x convert {} -define webp:size=128x128 -thumbnail '128x128' -background white -gravity center -extent 128x128 -strip -unsharp 0x.5 {.}_thumb.webp</code></p>

					<p>Then I move the files to where I need them.
						I <em>constantly</em> have to look this
						information up (to the point that I have an Emacs
						bookmark to the file/section), because when I use
						it, I always forget some options, which result in
						images that aren't square, but at least
						appropriately sized to 128px on one side.</p>
					<p>It's to the point that I have an Org-mode file
						dedicated to ensuring that I have that command
						above cemented somewhere that I can find it. I'm
						not sure why I don't write a shell script to do
						this for me, but I imagine I'd even forget I

					<p>If there was ever a package with a poorly

					<p>There is
						some <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-08/msg00752.html">recent
							discussion on the <code>emacs-devel</code> mailing
							list</a> about how using GTK as the UI backing for
						various "frame" chrome (think: toolbars, menus,
						etc.) is causing more issues than it resolves.
						Moreover, it has known open issues that they're
						relying on the GNOME developers to fix. This is
						unlikely to be fixed. Mainly because the GNOME
						developers
						are <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/merge_requests/4829">a
							bunch of children who think they know best</a> and
						have <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/221">a
							long-open bug detailing an issue that Emacs has
							with their system, that they have refused to
							fix</a>. I don't put any trust in a toolkit that
						behaves like that.</p>
					<p>Today, I decided to try and build Emacs on my
						own. On Debian, it's a pretty easy series of
						steps:</p>
					<p><code>apt install build-essential git</code></p>
					<p><code>apt build-dep emacs-lucid</code></p>
					<p><code>git clone --depth 1 --branch emacs-28 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git</code></p>
					<p><code>./autogen.sh</code></p>
					<p><code>./configure --with-x-toolkit=no</code></p>
					<p><code>make bootstrap</code></p>
					<p><code>make install</code></p>
					<p>This works well and builds a new(er) copy of
						Emacs than Debian stable contains. While some of
						my packages have reacted oddly to this, overall,
						it seems like a good upgrade. I don't use any of
						the menu/toolbars or the scrollbars, so those UI
						components don't affect me anyway.</p>
					<p>The idea of a toolkit-less Emacs that connects
						to X11 or Wayland is actually a great idea. It
						leaves the problems of any particular toolkit
						behind and can do their own thing. While I
						might <em>prefer</em> QT/KDE, this is the
						next-best thing (especially since it seems like
						there isn't much of an appetite for C++ in the
						Emacs system).</p>

					<p>I had been pretty down on Disney lately. Their
						prices are going up (along with everything
						else&hellip;), but during a recent date to Disney,
						my wife and I were able to join the virtual queue
						for the new Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind
						ride that was recently added/completed in Epcot.
						Historically, new rides have always been swamped,
						but the new virtual queue system (for all it's
						faults) is actually a smart solution to the
						overcrowding problem.</p>
					<p>The ride feels like a huge cross between Space
						Mountain's roller coaster in the dark, and
						a <em>vastly</em> better themed ride that has some
						great before and after ride features. The
						appearance of Terry Crews and the original cast
						(minus Bradely Cooper's Rocket, and Vin Diesl's
						Groot) makes the whole thing feel like an awesome
						adventure, rather than a roller-coaster.</p>
					<p>Personally, if you're able to get into the
						virtual queue, it's worth visiting Epcot for (yeah,
						the festivals are still going on, so there's
						that, <em>too</em>.)</p>

					<p>Eshell is such a cool terminal. Not only do I
						not have to leave Emacs to access a terminal, but
						this one (in particular amongst the Emacs shell
						modes) gives me access
						to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/">Tramp</a>.
						Tramp, for the uninitiated, allows you to access
						remote filesystems of various kinds. Things like
						SSH, telnet and even things like sudo can be
						access and even <em>chained together</em> to
						access what you're looking for. This functionality
						extends to many parts of Emacs, including Eshell.
						Accessing remote hosts, like this server, can be
						as easy as:
					<p><code>$ cd /ssh:me@host:/path/to/directory</code>
						Emacs/Tramp will access the host behind the scenes
						(prompting for authentication as needed) and give
						you access. Now I can do things like run commands
						against the host without having to pop open a new
						shell and do an ssh/sudo dance.</p>
					<p>It feels kind of like magic. You can just
						access hosts naturally and interact with them
						without breaking your flow, all using a 'single'
						tool, gaining access to the tooling and functions
						you've already become accustom to, and likely will
						be using to manipulate the
						data <em>anyway</em>.</p>
					<p>I wish more tools were as accommodating. KDE's
						Dolphin file browser comes close, but in using KIO
						for accessing remote filesystems, you end up
						having to deal with the data in Dolphin not being
						accessible anywhere else unless you have a newer
						version that utilizes KIO+FUSE.</p>

					<p>I, recently, decided to switch to i3 because I
						felt like I could be more efficient with my
						windows and handle more parts of the system with
						better tooling that I could directly control. This
						is not new, I used to use i3 on my desktop, paired
						with two monitors, it <em>was</em> pretty
						efficient. However, those were two 1920x1080
						displays, and not a (mostly) single 1366x768
						display.</p>
					<p>My trip report is that i3 is not really viable
						on small laptop displays. By "small", I mean low
						resolution. Having limited pixels makes it
						difficult to manage side-by-side windows without
						resorting to using the tabbed window layout, or
						selectively full-screening them. For some cases,
						it's fine. I can swap the vertical split mode for
						the horizontal one, and use a terminal under the
						browser, for example. However, lots of other cases
						are just more annoying. I have to keep a sort of
						mental state of how the next window is going to
						open, and if that's going to make it more
						difficult to manage. I can set floating on
						different items, but finding them without them
						being sticked to the top can be frustrating.
						Actually, app management in general is
						frustrating. Trying to switch between apps, can be
						slower and tedious. If I need to find a specific
						window, often I need to use another program to
						find it. Whereas on a "stacking" window manager,
						I can alt-tab my way through windows. There are
						doubtless ways to fix these kinds of shortcomings,
						but the small real-estate and the somewhat limited
						keyboarding space makes it difficult to really
						feel more productive.</p>
					<p>The other issue I ran into is that laptops have
						a lot of ephemeral parts. Things like docking
						stations, monitors, keyboards, mice and need to
						frequently change wireless or wired networks. All
						of these things <em>can</em> be managed
						individually just fine, but having it all work in
						concert is frustrating. When docking and
						undocking, I found I had to run scripts to
						manually rearrange my display layout, sometimes
						leaving me with a freshly undocked laptop with
						nothing on the screen until I blindly ran a script
						to reset it. The issue compounds itself when they
						keyboard layout changes from the internal to an
						external or vice-versa. A keyboard mapping for
						swapping the <kbd>capslock</kbd>
						and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> keys will break in such a
						situation, as the mapping is usually only good for
						one keyboard.</p>
					<p>Using something like KDE, on the other hand,
						had/has none of these problems. Docking and
						undocking do "the right things". Networking, and
						other connectivity management are handled
						seamlessly, and keyboard mappings stay applied to
						any keyboard plugged in. It's really nice.</p>
					<p>While I love i3 and tiling as
						such <em>neat</em> solutions to the multi-window
						interface metaphor, I don't think they're well
						suited for mobile devices. That's not a bad thing.
						They have their niche, just like "windows"-like
						desktops work well for laptops, but not for
						tablets or phones.</p>

				<section>
					<p>I've decided in my quest to simplify Emacs down
						to the bare minimum acceptable configuration that
						I can tollerate that I will use the
						Emacs <code>Skeleton</code> package over the more
						robust, but ultimately not-included in the
						defaults, <code>yasnippet</code> package. I
						like <code>yasnippet</code> just fine, really. If
						I did more programming, I guess I would have more
						use for it, since it makes creating and expanding
						snippets almost magical. However, I am not a
						programmer, and with <code>yasnippet</code>
						included it feels like I've added yet more bloat
						to an already &hellip; healthy configuration
						size. Besides, why go out and buy a super deluxe
						hammer when the base model that came with your
						toolbox is vastly more than you need already?</p>

					<p>So, <code>Skeletons</code>, what are they? As
						part of the autotype features of Emacs, they're
						designed to alliveate typing frequently inserted
						things.</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The simplest kind of skeleton will simply
							insert some text indented according to the
							major mode and leave the cursor at a
							likely place in the middle. Interactive
							skeletons may prompt you for a string that
							will be part of the inserted text.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>Initially, it feels like skeletons are just
						fancy function syntax. You <i>define</i> them in
						much the same way you would a function: </p>

					<pre><code>(define-skeleton name
  "doc string"
  "What is your name? "
  "Hello, " str)</code></pre>

					<p>Part of my reasoning for this is that you can
						do all sorts of werid stuff inside skeletons, like
						set variables, process text and more. Sure, there
						is extra syntax for doing other, <i>more
							snippet-like</i> things, but it helped me
						understand the concept when migrating
						from <code>yasnippet</code>. The concept of how
						things work in skeletons seems like it should be
						documented <i>way</i> better than it is. I
						actually had to look up what other people had done
						just to get an idea for how I could implement some
						of the things I needed. Once I got that under
						control, I was on much more sure footing.</p>

					<p>One of the werid thing is that the second line
						of the skeleton is actually something you can use
						to prompt the user. If you were to run that code
						above, you would be prompted for your name. You
						can substitute other expressions in here, or
						even <code>nil</code>, if you don't need anything.
						Sometimes you'll <i>want</i> to ignore the user
						until you're good and ready, so they also provide
						stuff like <code>(skeleton-read "Text: ")</code>
						that allows you to further prompt the user. Using
						that with <code>let</code> or <code>setq</code>
						gives you lots of flexibility.</p>

					<p>One thing I haven't yet figured out is how to
						make it indent correctly. Maybe there is a setting
						to just do what the mode indention rules
						say&#x2026; I mean, it <i>is</i> Emacs, and I'm
						sure this has come up before me. Though,
						with <code>embrace-commander</code>
						and <code>&lt;Tab&gt;</code>, it's a trivial task
						to fix the alignment when done. This is especially
						useful for me while editing my site's
						HTML/XML.</p>

					<p>Maybe I should come up with a guide to what I
						know and learn about <code>skeleton</code> mode,
						like how it integrates with <code>abbrev</code>
						for easier insertion of snippets.</p>

					<pre><code>;; Example from M-x edit-abbrevs &lt;RET&gt;
;; This runs the 'name' skeleton when you insert
;; whitespace after typing "hello" in an org buffer
(org-mode-abbrev-table)

"hello" 0 "" name</code></pre>

					<p>I'm going to head back into the manual. It's
						not always an obvious read, but there is usually
						something there that surprises me. Maybe,one day,
						I'll master it.</p>

					<p>I had a small amount of friction in Emacs when
						deploying this site. Often, I'd be in some file
						deeper in the project than the root, then decide I
						want to deploy after making changes. In VSCode,
						the build steps worked fine, as it had explicit
						instructions on how to do it. For Emacs, though, I
						opted for a simple <code>Makefile</code>. This,
						however, posed a bit of a problem: In Emacs, the
						"working directory" is wherever that buffer's file
						happens to be. Which means when you invoke
						<code>M-x compile</code>, <code>make</code> would
						fail, because there was no <code>Makefile</code>
						in the directory that that buffer is visiting. As
						a work-around, I would visit the root
						<code>index.html</code> file and run compile from
						there. Not great, but it worked.
					</p>
					<p>I recently <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/08/22/">ran
							across a blog post that fixed all this</a> for me
						with the simplest inclusion.</p>
					<pre>
						<code>
(defun my-compile ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((default-directory (locate-dominating-file "." "Makefile")))
    (compile "make")))
						</code>
					</pre>
					<p><em>Of course</em> Emacs has a tool to do this.
						Apparently this <code>locate-dominating-file</code> is
						oft-underused, but wow, what a difference!</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Starting at FILE, look up directory
							hierarchy for directory containing NAME.
							FILE can be a file or a directory. If it’s
							a file, its directory will serve as the
							starting point for searching the hierarchy
							of directories. Stop at the first parent
							directory containing a file NAME, and
							return the directory.</p>
						<cite>Shockingly, not officially documented in the Emacs manual.</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>I wonder what else lies, lurking below the
						surface, waiting to be discovered and improve my
						experience.</p>

					<p>I hit 300 pounds today. After a month of cruise
						food, eating out and generally being mindlessly
						eating, I hit a milestone I never thought I could,
						and one I dreaded for so long. I'd like to say
						I've learned something along the way, but I feel
						like I'm just continuing to drift and go through
						the motions of the day. I still go to gym 3 days a
						week, and I sweat up a storm, but that probably
						doesn't dent my idle eating. I have WW, which I've
						been paying for, but I haven't used it in a while.
						In short: I'm in a deep funk.</p>
					<p>One of my biggest problems is availability of
						cheap junk food. There is a vending machine here
						at this satellite office I'm working in, and
						because my eating habits are all messed up, my
						willpower evaporates when I'm the slightest bit
						bored. I can easily purchase ~1000+ calories of
						junk for less than $3. Which I can easily justify
						for myself, even for stretches as long as a week.</p>
					<p>My wife, in her infinite wisdom, would probably
						say something to the effect of: "Well, okay, what
						are you going to do about it <em>now</em> and in
						the <em>future</em>?". She's smart, because she
						knows you can't change what you've <i>done</i>,
						only what you're going to do. Why she puts up with
						my constant crap is anyone's guess, but I won't
						complain about her sage advice. I'll try and put
						it to good use.</p>
					<h3>
						What I'm Going to Do About It
					</h3>
					<p>I've been doing some preliminary thinking, and I
						think I can do two things at once: Deprive myself
						of the matériel to make bad choices <em>and</em>
						give to charity/open source projects. To that end,
						here's one idea:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Find 3 charities/open source projects</li>
						<li>Setup a monthly recurring payment (change per month?)</li>
						<li>Bring more healthy snacks to help curb boredom hunger</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Of course, this doesn't get to the
						<em>root</em> of the issue, which seems to be
						boredom. I've tried to fix that with Emacs
						customizing and Morrowind, but those eventually
						lose their shiny attraction. That sends me back to
						idly browsing the
						Internet/Reddit/HackerNews/Github/IRC while
						waiting for scheduled appointments to come and go.
					</p>
					<p>That problem may require more thought and
						effort. I still plan on going to gym, I still plan
						on using WW, but I need more hooks... Something to
						work on.</p>

					<p>My wife, has been pretty frustrated with
						Windows 11 lately. The new UI changes are rubbing
						her the wrong way, since they changed it so much
						and removed some customizations that made her
						comfortable. I can understand that feeling, given
						how much I customize Linux and Emacs, it can be
						frustrating to have a new UI paradigm forced on
						you.</p>
					<p>I also know that I have little difficulty
						adapting to odd interfaces. I use all of "the big
						three" OSes daily, and I am able to be productive
						in each. For most people, they want to use their
						tools without the fundamental interface changing
						too much. Yes, change is constant, but the idea of
						hammer being a poundy thing on the end of a stick
						hasn't changed much in thousands of years.</p>
					<p>As I get older, I wonder if this desire for
						less "churn" in familiar things is a function of
						that aging process. The desire to see faithful
						tools and things be the same as they were at their
						most familiar. I also see this in a lot of
						contemporary things. Conservatives, for example,
						seem to want for things to go "back to the way
						things were", as if they were simpler or more
						"sensible".</p>
					<p>I also find that I'm falling into the same
						thinking trap. I pine for the days when things
						were simpler, or less complex, or just "easier and
						more familiar". Anytime I find myself thinking
						this kind of thing, I try to look at it more
						objectively. However, it's very easy to fall back
						into the trap. I guess it just means that I have
						to be more mindful about how I look at situations
						and how I respond to them.</p>

					</section>
					<p>I've been getting back into Morrowind, now that
						<a href="https://openmw.com/">OpenMW</a> is fully
						working with the base game and it's expansions.
						Plus, the game runs on basically anything that has
						come out in the past 10 years, including potatoes.
						While the graphics are … not great, the story and
						RPG systems <em>are</em>.
					</p>
					<p>Since it’s release in 2002, I played Morrowind
						<em>a lot</em>. Despite my computer barely being
						able to handle it at the time. It was amazing. A
						truly open world where you could go and do
						anything. Want to follow the main story? Sure, go
						right ahead. Want to go drink Skooma and sprint
						around at stupid fast speed until it wears off?
						Sure, kid. Want to become the Archmage
						<em>and</em> the head of the Thieves Guild? With a
						little finagling, you can be them <em>both</em>!
						You were given the tools to play and some story to
						go on, and told to have fun (much like the
						parenting at that age… <em>ba-dum-tisk</em>).
					</p>
					<p>Open Morrowind has rekindled my love for this
						game. While it’s very thoroughly <em>broken</em>
						in many ways, it’s also a monument to what “open”
						can mean. We have a dearth of “open world” games,
						now. The problem is that many of these games
						define open in almost a sandbox or amusement park
						kind of way. There is <em>stuff</em> to do, but a
						lot of it is really shallow and boring. With
						Morrowind and Oblivion (and to a lesser extent,
						Skyrim), you not only had stuff to do, but much of
						it was story-rich and engaging. Not to mention,
						the immersion of not telling you exactly where to
						go, but just giving some very human (read: vague)
						directions invites exploration and discovery.</p>
					<p>OpenMW is keeping this lovely game alive and
						inviting a whole new generation of gamers to pick
						up and experience one of the true classics of the
						RPG/Open World genre. One that helped spark off a
						slew of copycats that never really stood up to the
						original. For that, I thank them.</p>

					<p>Well, my parents just sold their house. That
						means my childhood home is no longer going to be
						in the family. I'm not sure that strikes me as
						sad, or good, or just indifferent. I suppose it
						should have <em>some</em> sort of influence on me,
						but I'm finding it difficult to react one way or
						the other.</p>
					<p>I mean, I know I'm happy for <em>them</em>.
						It's a big change for them, and now that they're
						retiring, they want to spend more time with my
						son, which means moving down here. All of that is
						good, in many ways. I'm sure it'll be a change for
						myself and Erin's family, but it'll work out. So,
						why the "meh" feeling?</p>
					<p>I guess I've just been so <em>disconnected</em>
						from my parents, from Maine, that I don't really
						consider myself <em>part</em> of that place
						anymore. It's been so long, that I'm rounding the
						corner on having been <em>here</em> longer than I
						have lived <em>there</em>. That's not to say I
						don't miss some things, but those things are
						largely gone, or have changed, or I have changed.
						I just don't feel connected to it anymore.</p>
					<p>Maybe I'll feel something when visiting it for
						the last time. Maybe I'm just broken... who knows?</p>

					<p>Yes, I know I'm a day late. I watched Obi-won

						Marvel uninterrupted.</p>
					<p>What a treat it was!</p>
					<p>I had read most of the early comics of hers
						when they came out, so some differences
						were a little suspect, but given that the only
						mention of the Terragen Mists was in a different
						reality... we'll let it slide.</p>
					<p>Imani is absolutely great in her role, and her
						family dynamics feel fluid and awkwardly real.
						While I'm not a child of immigrant parents, I felt
						like there was enough of the teenage experience

						Teenagers <em>know</em> how it feels to be denied

					<p><b>Note:</b> I'll be getting those photos
						sorted soon enough. They're uploaded, but I just
						can't be bothered with the markup right now...</p>
					<p>I, recently, was assigned a brand-new Macbook
						Pro at work. We're getting a bunch of new-hires in
						that will be using them, so we need to ensure
						they'll work with our environment. While that's
						not really a concern of mine, I understood that
						this came from higher up on the food chain, and
						did what I needed to do.</p>
					<p>One thing I like to pride myself on is being
						versitile. I can use lots of different operating
						environments and still be mostly productive. While
						I have a some Windows-centric things for my
						position, the rest is mostly just email and phone
						calls.</p>
					<p>For a lot of my life, I was an Apple user. I
						had a big 'ole Grey iMac G3 and a Powerbook G4 as
						well as varying newer models. I've also been a
						long time iPhone user, which makes being a Mac
						user an easy decision, especially as the two
						platforms have grown closer. I've also been a
						frequent Linux user and a professional Windows
						support jockey. Finding middle ground between all
						of these platforms hasn't been easy, and usually
						takes a heaping amount of compromise.</p>
					<p>Recently, though I can't find the blog post it
						was in, I expressed interest in going "all in"
						with Apple. I already use their phones, their
						music and movies, I may as well settle in for a
						well integrated (at the cost of being more
						flexible) experience and let my fortunes be what
						it may.</p>
					<p>However. I spent a decent amount of time poking
						around in the newer versions of macOS, only to be
						disappointed at how stripped down it has
						become. Sure, I could rely on Homebrew to paper
						over some of that, but it feels like I'm either no
						longer the target demographic, or I'm fooling
						myself into believing that I'm something that I'm
						not. Recently, I feel like it could be either of
						those things.</p>
					<p>Reading that Apple is stripping out all
						scripting languages like Python, Perl, Ruby and
						more is disheartening, but it doesn't really
						affect me. As I've said before: <em>I'm not a
							programmer</em>. I do, however, feel like just
						knowing this strips some luster away. Sure,
						their hardware feels great, and the performance is
						impressive, but to what end? I'm just a regular
						power user, now. I write some HTML and CSS, tinker
						with some configuration, and read comics and the
						news. Isn't it time I get real and choose a
						platform that emphasises <em>those</em>
						experiences?</p>
					<p>I wish it were as simple as that. Having a
						Linux machine tells me that freedom is liberating,
						if exhausting. Windows tells me that a consistent,
						long-term experience is a value in-of-its-own. Mac
						tells me that for better or worse, we're all going
						to be shoehorned into choices that we may not on
						the surface <em>like</em>, but fit ourselves
						better.</p>
					<p>Computers really are something awful.</p>

				<section>
					<p>One of the ongoing debates in my head, and I
						imagine with most people, is do I use the "free"
						product, or is it worth paying for a more
						"premium" product? Often, this comes down to what
						you need out of it, and what you're willing to
						"put up with" as far as frustration and
						limitations are. For some, thriftiness is king and
						the use of nominally free products is more
						important than removing frustration and
						roadblocks. To others, having a frustration-free,
						or much easier/enjoyable experience is much more
						important than low cost. I would imagine that,
						like me, many fall somewhere in-between.</p>
					<p>For instance: I would never pay for a
						text-editor. With the dearth of absolutely
						incredible tooling out there, for free, and my
						relative needs, there isn't really any onus to
						buying something like that. However, I will
						absolutely pay for things or access to stuff like
						manga, music, movies, TV shows and others in lieu
						of simply pirating them from the many sources
						online. Same thing goes with email: I would rather
						pay for good email service rather than rely on
						"free" services, as my email is private
						communication and free services tend to infringe
						on that as part of the non-monetary cost.</p>
					<p>Search is an interesting subject. Like news,
						we've been conditioned to see search as something
						that has infinite value, and therefore should be
						free. From Altavista, Yahoo and Dogpile to Google,
						Bing and DuckDuckGo, we're continually told that
						search indexing is both free and invaluable. It's
						not until you actually look at the problem of
						search that you realize just how massively
						complicated and <em>expensive</em> it is to
						run. It's, therefore, small wonder that
						advertising and sponsored content is all the rage
						with search engines.</p>
					<p>I write all this because it seems like there
						isn't much to do about
						it. <a href="https://kevq.uk/is-duckduckgo-duckduckdone/">Others
							are musing about it</a>,
						and <a href="https://kagi.com/">some solutions
							have been created</a>, but it doesn't seem like
						there is any solid path forward. Do I need to pay
						for <em>every</em> service I want to use? That
						seems counter-productive or at the very least
						exclusionary to less well off users. It also
						brings up the idea of what is part of the critical
						infrastructure of the Internet. DNS, HTTP, SSL
						Certificates, routing... all behind the scenes
						services, all paid for by <em>someone</em>,
						usually a provider of some kind. However, what
						would it be like to pay for all of those things
						ala carte? Would they bundle? What kind of
						fragmented access would that provide? Should we
						add search to that stack? I know that search isn't
						a protocol, but it seems like the web is
						prohibitively large enough to need it. While I
						understand the problem is complex enough, that
						making it free without some kind of compensation
						is kind of a big ask, even for large companies
						with the capital to fund it. It still seems like a
						fundamental part of how we <em>use</em> the
						web.</p>
					<p>Search seems to be moving into an interesting
						place. Despite the size and complexity of it,
						there
						is <a href="https://searx.github.io/searx/">strong
							headway in making it more digestible</a> and
						easier to index through
						many <a href="https://www.opensearch.org/">open-source
							projects</a>. While not on the scale of their
						for-profit fore-bearers, they will seemingly make
						some kind of waves in the world of search. I could
						reasonably foresee a future where such indexes are
						distributed and each user has a small indexer that
						scrapes what is visited and distributes it to an
						aggregator. Though, that's also fraught with
						problems.</p>
					<p>I don't know if I like where this is all
						going. We've had this duopoly for ages now, and it
						seems like there is no quantitative relief in
						sight if you want a robust search engine that
						respects your privacy, gives you good results, and
						is accountable
						to <em>you</em>. Given <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-google-know-about-me-4587648">how
							much any average search engine knows about your
							personality through your
							searches</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/04/what-does-your-phone-know-about-you-more-than-you-think/237786/">it
							probably knows as much as your phone does, and
							that's a lot</a>.</p>

					<p>Managing this site at the pace that I am updating it is
						taking a bit of a toll on me. While I enjoy the viceral feel

						myself adding many more pages&hellip; but it does take
						cognitive effort to manage.</p>
					<p>I've been kicking around using Hugo, again, to manage the

				<section>
					<p>While pounding out some HTML and other crap content for
						this site, I stumbled upon some new features coming to CSS.
						Specifically: Layers.</p>
					<p>A CSS <code>layer</code> is like an extra precedence
						trick to allow you to apply sets of CSS with increasing or
						decreasing orders of specificity. The upshot is that you can
						now include your CSS resets, base typography, colors,
						utilities and <em>then</em> your customizations. As the
						browser works its way down the list, older/earlier rules get
						overwritten with newer ones until the layering has
						ended.</p>
					<p>This has a lot of potential with CSS frameworks, but it
						also has helpful organizational use for people like me.
						Allowing me to have a basic style ruleset, then layer
						customizations on top of it, without having to break out the
						<code>!important</code>'s to override tricky selectors. That
						way, code-wise, everything stays pristine. The browser is
						the mixologist.
					</p>
					<p>Too bad it's <em>too new</em> to use. If you're <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-cascade-layers">using less
							than version ~100 of your respective browser</a>, you'd be
						out of luck and (likely) get wacky results. Hopefully things
						get sorted out soon.</p>

					<p>So, I'm going on a little trip with my
						family. It's going to be a long airline ride, and
						probably more driving on top of that. So, in order
						to help with duration, and to help cut down on the
						screen time, I've started looking, again, into
						print and play games.</p>
					<p>I've done this once before, during the pandemic (well,
						it's <em>still</em> the pandemic, but 2 years on
						already&hellip;). I printed
						<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163310/supermarche">
							Supermarche
						</a>,
						<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197097/four-against-darkness">
							Four Against Darkness
						</a> (bought),
						<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255360/bargain-basement-bathysphere">
							Bargan Basement Bathyspheres (of Beachside Bay)
						</a>, and
						<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75223/utopia-engine">
							Utopia Engine
						</a>. Many of these I just sent to Kinkos/FedEx/Whatever to
						get printed on nice stock or laminated for multiple plays.
						This time, I've chosen a few new ones.
					</p>
					<p>I was really tempted to print
						<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/340909/gloomholdin">
							Gloomholdin'
						</a>,
						but I tend not to be in the mood to play something complex
						in a confined space. I'd rather spread out and enjoy a
						complex experience. Travel also makes complex things
						frustrating. I don't think anyone is going to want to be any
						more frustrated than they will be. To that end, I've sent
						~$17 worth of printing on nice card stock to FedEx:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183571/deep-space-d-6">Deep Space D6</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199242/mini-rogue-9-card-print-and-play-game">Mini Rouge</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Both have simple rules and simple materials. Mini Rouge

					<p>I <em>love</em> Emacs. I really do. I use for lots of
						things. <em>However</em>, I absolutely love using VSCode for
						web stuff, and Python. It <em>feels</em> like there is a
						more comfortable setup configured for these languages than
						in Emacs. I imagine I <em>could</em> make Emacs work better,
						but at what time cost to me?</p>
					<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thinking about this,
						Emacs feels like an all-or-nothing affair. When
						you use Emacs, you're
						practically <em>encouraged</em> to use it for
						everything. I mean, why leave if you can access
						all or most of your tools from within Emacs? Need
						to kill a process? <kbd>M-x proced</kbd>. Need to
						read some email? <kbd>M-x mail</kbd> (or one of
						the many variants). Need a terminal? <kbd>M-x
							eshell</kbd>. Even things like organization,
						calendaring, note-taking and chat can all be
						done <em>inside</em> Emacs. It becomes an integral
						part of your life, except when you can't use
						it. Which means while on the go you're stuck
						without your second brain. One of the biggest
						reasons I kind of stopped using it was due to
						this. Even as I type these words into Emacs, I
						know that it doesn't <em>quite</em> fit for
						me. Which is sad, because I like it so much.</p>

					<p>Woof, Impostor Syndrome. Story of my life.</p>
					<p>I spent nearly ten years working on websites and doing
						"coding" (for whatever values of that you're willing to
						accept for writing <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor Language">
							PHP</abbr>). This was a position I inherited
						because I had tinkered with it as a kid and had an affinity
						for it. I was far from being a <em>professional</em>.</p>
					<p>I often have to remind myself that I am <em>not</em>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A developer</li>
						<li>An artist or creative type</li>
						<li>A systems engineer</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I have an expertise in doing desktop support. That's
						pretty much it. Everything else is just me learning enough
						to be, as Kev puts: "dangerous". I sometimes think that
						everyone behaves this way, and no one is an expert. However,
						that is clearly not the case. People may not know every
						aspect of a thing they have expertise in. However, for all
						intents and purposes, they're an 'expert'. I just wish I
						knew where the line was.</p>

					<p>It's been a whole day, now, without smell or taste.
						At first, it was a novel thing. I was intrigued by the

						lacked anything particularly defining about it. The

					<p>I can't seem to sleep lately. I, at least for now, am

					<p>I should probably cut back on those. However, they do help

					<p>I've been one to throw myself into awkward
						computing situations. Frequently, I install new
						updates and explore features that are barely
						tested. In short: I don't shy away from "new". Even if
						it's a big change. I spent more than a year booting
						from a floppy to load BeOS when even <em>Firefox</em>
						was barely working on it. I've toyed around with
						different Linux window managers, including ones like
						DWM which require you to know some C to configure it,
						compiling it after each change. Hell, I used Emacs and
						Notmuch mail with <em>POP3</em> in 2021
						on <em>Exchange</em> because I thought it'd be
						neat.</p>
					<p>I don't know why, then, that Windows 11 rubs me
						so <em>wrong</em>.</p>
					<p>It's not like the interface has changed so
						dramatically that I can't work anymore. I feel like
						it's a death from a thousand small cuts. From menu
						items appearing cramped and odd looking. To the total
						revamp of the Settings application and how nothing
						works right. 11 should have been Microsoft's time to
						absolutely blow people away with the runaway success
						of 10. My first login experience was multiple messages
						about some Teams DLLs not being correct for my
						platform. Again, I shouldn't be bothered by any of
						this, but I am.</p>

					<p>I'm also really bothered because I feel like the
						Windows 10 install on my old potato computer is as
						good as it can get. Upgrading to 11 on a newer laptop
						feels like it would be a wash, both in productivity
						and in functionality. I mean, I plan on upgrading
						at <em>some point</em>. I just don't know when. This
						makes me strongly reconsider Linux, though I'm not in
						love with that idea, either.</p>

					<p>What an absolute tool. I don't even know why I bother with

						projects that he has no intention of finishing, or even

					<p><a href="https://ar.al/2018/08/27/better-blocker-two-year-review-and-thoughts-on-the-future/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Not 3 years ago, Aral was talking
							about how their iOS ad-blocking app "Better Blocker" was doing
							middling-ly well</a>, but gave them a decent chunk of change a
						year (more than some make doing <em>actual jobs</em>). Now,
						because Apple didn't fight doing searches for child pornography
						on people's photos, they've taken it down.</p>
					<p>Mind you, Better Blocker was a <em>paid</em> application. One
						that required only maintenance to stay in line with the app
						store rules and to throw up block list updates on some external
						server. Not exactly rocket science. When they took down their
						app, they didn't even bother to tell paid users. It just stops
						updating. The app page is unavailable and there is nothing but a
						blog post on his personal site about it. Wonderful.</p>
					<p>What a pretentious douchebag. If you want to steer clear of
						non-profits doing more harm than good, then stay away from the
						so-called "Small Technology Foundation". Nothing good comes from
						either of these two grifters using the guise of non-profit to
						live a privileged life..</p>

					<p>Sometimes I find it hard to write about <em>anything</em>

						history on Fosstodon was any indication, I had a hard time
						shutting up. I just have a hard time coming up with things to
						talk about <em>at length</em>.</p>
					<p>For instance, I've been playing Downfall, a Slay the Spire
						mod which lets you play as the bosses. I've been picking back up
						Marvel Champions now that the spider-verse expansion is out.
						I've also been hand-wringing, trying to decide if I want to get
						a new laptop or not spend that kind of money on, essentially, a
						gaming platform that does other utility things. I've also been
						massively busy with school and work because it's getting toward

						them. I take all this with a grain of salt, though, because I'm

					<p>I kind of see why there is a growing trend of people doing

					<p>Once upon a time, I watched a movie/documentary called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi">"Jiro
							Dreams of Sushi"</a>, a delightful film about this master sushi
						chef that has a small, but extremely exclusive sushi restaurant
						in the bottom of a Tokyo office building. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Ono_(chef)">Jiro</a>,
						the titular character, is a man driven by the desire to perfect
						his sushi and delight his patrons. Spoilers: He does so.</p>
					<p>Jiro's sushi is served in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakase">omakase</a>,
						translated as "I'll leave it up to you [the chef]". You don't
						order food like you would at a traditional restaurant. You come
						in, sit down and are fed what the chef has in mind for the
						night. Sometimes this is pre-set for a particular season,
						sometimes it changes on the chef's whim or availability of
						ingredients. Regardless, it's a very fascinating experience.</p>
					<p>That all being said, <a href="https://www.norikase.com/">my
							wife recently discovered that there is an omakase-style
							restaurant in town</a> that is just sort of getting started. It's
						got a small, ten-person seating for the omakase event, and she
						got us seats for our anniversary. What a delight it was. I've
						never had sushi like this, nor have I had any sushi that
						compares.</p>

					<p>Seventeen courses. That seems like a lot, thinking about it.
						However, you're eating your meal roughly one bite at a time, so

					<p>It feels weird to say it, but hover events (mouse style) are
						becoming old-fashioned selectors on the web. That's not to say
						that there aren't <em>plenty</em> of users using mouse and
						keyboard on the web. It's just that there are probably <em>many
							more</em> on their phones or tablets, browsing your site. These
						users don't have any standard method of triggering these
						events.</p>
					<p>Just earlier today, I was working on some CSS on my site,
						when I noticed that the hover events don't work well with touch
						screens. I understand <em>why</em>, but the workarounds&hellip;
						don't spark joy. <a href="https://git.degruchy.link/ndegruchy/degruchy-org/src/commit/4a7f1d74882727e87574e08476941144636496d2/index.html#L800">One
							I found</a>, a is just a sort of open-ended loaded the
						<code>touchstart</code> event and things &#x2728; magically &#x2728;
						worked.
					</p>
					<p>I'm pretty sure that we're not far off from a future where
						hover events are a legacy thing that gets added to tick a box. I
						hope I'm wrong, maybe screens will get a near-touch hover event.
						Who knows...</p>
					<p>For anyone looking to be pedantic, like me, you can wrap
						your <code>:hover</code> psuedo-selectors in a <code>@media
				screen and (hover: hover)</code> to gate the effects behind a
						feature lookup. <b>Note:</b> this appears to be hit-or miss as
						mobile browsers will sometimes fire hover events on hover-esque
						touches. So, <abbr title="Your Mileage May Vary">YMMV</abbr>.</p>

					<p>I don't care much for OneNote as a note-taking tool. It works
						alright, but it's slow and often feels sloppy and disorganized.
						I, much prefer plain text. It's universal and note prone to
						corruption like the former. So, then why is it so hard to have
						everywhere?</p>
					<h3>Bear</h3>
					<p>What a beautiful app. Too bad it's probably the worst. Not
						only do you pay $1.49/mo. for sync on its own systems, but you
						don't even get web access for non-Apple platforms. No choice of
						sync to preferred services.</p>
					<h3 id="emacs">Emacs</h3>
					<p>Ah, yes, my favorite editor. Not really something that you
						would call a &quot;markdown&quot; editor, specifically. However,
						it <em>does</em> edit Markdown, and it can save to any location
						the device has access to, including OneDrive or iCloud. There is
						just one problem: No iOS. Not surprising, really, but it makes
						it a shitty cross-platform tool for taking notes.</p>
					<h3 id="byline">Byline</h3>
					<p>Another iOS, Markdown-focused editor. Saves to a number of
						locations, just not OneDrive, not even through the files' app.
						While you can <em>access</em> already created notes on it, you
						can&#39;t start them there.</p>
					<h3 id="ios-notes">iOS Notes</h3>
					<p>It saves notes in Exchange Online (or iCloud) and syncs with
						Outlook and kind of OneNote, but not really. Also, very limited
						if you&#39;re not using iCloud as the back-end.</p>
					<h3 id="onenote">OneNote</h3>
					<p>Has decent enough applications for Windows, macOS and iOS
						(and Android), syncs with OneDrive and has connections to notes
						in Exchange Online. Has lots of features and whatnot. It&#39;s
						just slow, clunky and unintuitive and messy and... bleh.</p>
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>Is OneNote really the only answer? &#x2639;</p>

					<p>There are a lot of ways to automate things. PHP has,
						<a href="https://wordpress.org" rel="nofollow">historically</a>,
						been very good at making HTML templated things like blogs. Even
						as it has expanded in purpose with command-line utility, it
						still does and amazing job at sticking content in HTML and
						sending that to a browser.
					</p>
					<p>So seductive is this ability to make content appear in HTML
						that even stupidly trivial things, like this page, whisper their
						almost silent promises of making it <em>so much</em> easier to
						write and publish on it. Thankfully, this has already been done
						to death by a dearth of links to abandoned PHP projects smeared
						across the gleaming black and white surface of GitHub's project
						listings pages.</p>
					<p>Would I like to make this whole process easier? <em>Of course
							I would.</em> That's not the point, though.</p>
					<p>I <em>could</em> implement a PHP page to iterate through a
						directory of Markdown files and render them unto this page. I
						<em>could</em> have a PHP powered image pipeline to crop, slice,
						dice and thumbnailize images included on the page. I'm fairly
						sure I could even <em>create</em> those things myself.
					</p>
					<p>I don't like that, though. It feels cheap. It feels &hellip;
						sterile and formless. I don't <em>want</em> that because I'm
						tired of managing <em>that</em>. The workflows, the process,
						making sure things go right. Setting up infrastructure on my
						laptop to make sure that the code I'm pushing doesn't break on
						the server.</p>
					<p><em>Feh!</em></p>
					<p>I have a preview function in VSCode, and even if I didn't,
						the dwindling number of browsers out there would be more than
						sufficient for the task.</p>
					<p>I'm not above a certain level of irony and dissonance. I
						<em>know</em> that VSCode is basically a hyper-fancy webpage for
						writing code. I <em>know</em> that most applications I use are
						just webpages gussied up and mangled beyond their original
						intents. But this is <em>my</em> site, and <em>I</em> get to
						make the rules.

								F.O.M.O. or "The Fear of Missing Out"
							</a>

						<dd>
							Fear of missing out (FOMO) is the feeling of
							apprehension that one is either not in the know or
							missing out on information, events, experiences, or life
							decisions that could make one's life better. FOMO is
							also associated with a fear of regret, which may lead
							to concerns that one might miss an opportunity for
							social interaction, a novel experience, a memorable
							event, or a profitable investment.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<p><a href="#20220309-antisocial">I have a problem with Social
							Media.</a> It stems from my underlying depression. With social
						media, I can create a persona that is similar to me, but is
						designed to be a much more sympathetic overview. To what end?
						More interaction.</p>
					<p>The more replies, likes, boosts and other buttons, the more
						my head gets a tiny little dopamine kick. String those along for
						enough time, and it becomes habit. The problem with this, though,
						is that while dopamine is all well and good. It doesn't keep you
						coming back. That's where FOMO comes into play.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>"A challenge is that the part of our brain that
							reinforces behaviors is stimulated by novelty; social media
							scrolling always promises something new with the next
							scroll."</p>
						<cite>Dr. Michael Jaffee, director of the Neurology Sleep
							Clinic at the University of Florida</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Forget drugs! Scrolling Reddit, Twitter or Mastodon allows
						you to get that "just <em>one</em> more" satisfaction.
						Infinitely. That makes it not only hard to quit, full stop, but
						also hard to just put down.</p>
					<p>For me, it wasn't something I could handle responsibly. I
						tried, like the author, to do things like:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>While app developers want to keep you engaged for as long
							as possible, most of them do offer tools to limit screen
							use. So I did what I don't think (anecdotally) many people
							do — I set up time limits on my social media apps like
							Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to help manage my screen use
							before bed with the hopes of getting more sleep.</p>
						<p>&hellip;</p>
						<p>Sometimes it worked and I would surrender my phone to my
							bedside table, irritated but also appreciative of the sweet
							relief of darkness on my eyes. But other times I would plug
							in the passcode, ignoring the tinge of regret that pinched
							my stomach and knowledge that my future self would be angry
							— and tired — in the morning.</p>
						<cite>Katie Camero, BuzzFeed News Reporter</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Only to ignore the rules I had set for myself and just plow
						on, unhindered. It was really surreal the first few times, and
						pretty much automatic by the time I had my blow up. For me, the
						problem wasn't lack of sleep. It was the crumbling relationships
						I had ignored for too long. Worse than being tired or cranky, I
						had to deal with real human issues around my addiction. I still
						do.</p>
					<p>I feel it still. The need to post pithy little comments.
						Engage in conversation and insider's humor. Every time, though,
						I need to understand that it's not <em>that</em> important.
						Especially it's not important enough to interrupt family time,
						or other important events, where I should be present.</p>
					<p>To that end, I am seeking professional help for my addiction.
						I know I need help, and now I'm going to get it. Maybe one day
						I'll be in control enough to re-engage with social media, but my
						suspicion is that I am going to have to treat this like
						Alcoholism and just abstain.</p>

					<p>I've been using social media a <em>lot</em>. My drug of
						choice is the federated system known as Mastodon. It's an
						ad-free, user supported system of services that have no one
						central point of control or failure. This means you can chat
						with all kinds of people on all kinds of wacky subjects.</p>
					<p>That's kind of the problem.</p>
					<p>I've been using it as a substitute for my own life. I've used
						it in ways that have hurt others, but mostly I've used it for
						the minimal dopamine kick that you get when someone does &hellip;
						whatever, respond, like &hellip; etc. Small kicks frequently enough
						over time make you feel good, in control and liked. Regardless
						of the actual state of things.</p>
					<p>Destroying my life for a dopamine kick isn't exactly
						sustainable. Hence, my abstinence.</p>
					<p>To help fill that void, I've decided that I want to journal
						more. I got a book and a pen, and I've been writing. I also have
						this blog to help me with that. Despite my misgivings around
						WordPress, I've tabled them until I can get my head and life
						straightened out.</p>
					<p>I'm going to take this opportunity to take a good hard look
						at myself and what I get out of the tools and systems I use. I
						want to be enriched by things, not dragged into small highs that
						I seek more and more of to the detriment of everything else.</p>
					<p>So, if you're looking for me. I'm here, just not there.</p>

					<p>I used to like WordPress. Back when it was just a nascent
						blogging platform with spaghetti code PHP and a friendly
						interface.</p>
					<p>However, it's turned into a monster. A monster that wants to
						be everything to everyone without actually fixing anything. This
						feels dangerous, as it doesn't feel like anything substantial is
						being done to help ensure that the codebase is more organized or
						easier to interface with. Instead, they add features, like
						Gutenberg, and press the "advantages" of "Full Site Editing".
						Throwing the theme world on it's head, pushing more and more
						features into JavaScript instead of using the proper tooling
						already installed on the server. They push more WooCommerce
						plugins and online store updates to monetize and drive
						"engagement" and "click throughs" and "sales".</p>
					<p>I want the <em>old</em> WordPress back. The one that was
						designed to be a blogging platform. It filled a niche that was
						needed, and left the more generic Content Management to the
						heavy-hitters like Joomla and Drupal. You can see the fragments
						of the fevered development in where they put things in the
						database. Tables once only intending to hold one type of content
						now layer lots of different options and configurations in a
						haphazard manner. Things like theme customizations appearing in
						the post content tables alongside block customizations. Term
						tables house post content information. It's chaos.</p>
					<p>So, for now, I'm back to hand-editing this content, in a text
						editor and uploading it to my server and serving it statically.
						No content management system like Hugo, no PHP or Laravel or
						Node.js. Just me, an editor and a bit of time. I'm sure a time
						will come where I migrate to (or back to) something. Right now,
						I'm just enjoying the feeling.</p>
