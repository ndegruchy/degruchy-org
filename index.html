					<p>Managing this site at the pace that I am updating it is
					taking a bit of a toll on me. While I enjoy the viceral feel
					of hand crafting HTML and CSS, I am getting <em>tired</em>
					of managing the entire tree myself. This is felt
					particularly hard when I add pages. Granted, I don't foresee
					myself adding many more pages&hellip; but it does take
					cognitive effort to manage.</p>
					<p>I've been kicking around using Hugo, again, to manage the
					site. It's powerful and neat and entirely too much for what
					I need. Or maybe it's just enough. No idea. It's all
					experimental. I don't like the templating situation, it's
					entirely overcomplicated. The shortcode situation is also
					one that requires thought. While I can see it being useful,
					I'm not sure I want to dig into it, yet.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, there's no cure for burn out better than
					going on vacation! So, that's what I'm doing. I don't
					<em>think</em> I'll post from it, but I'm obviously too vain
					to promise anything of the sort.</p>

				<section class="article-content e-content">
					<p>While pounding out some HTML and other crap content for
					this site, I stumbled upon some new features coming to CSS.
					Specifically: Layers.</p>
					<p>A CSS <code>layer</code> is like an extra precidence
					trick to allow you to apply sets of CSS with increasing or
					decreasing orders of specificity. The upshot is that you can
					now include your CSS resets, base typography, colors,
					utilities and <em>then</em> your customizations. As the
					browser works its way down the list, older/earlier rules get
					overwritten with newer ones until the layering has
					ended.</p>
					<p>This has a lot of potential with CSS frameworks, but it
					also has helpful organizational use for people like me.
					Allowing me to have a basic style ruleset, then layer
					customizations on top of it, without having to break out the
					<code>!important</code>'s to override tricky selectors. That
					way, code-wise, everything stays pristine. The browser is
					the mixologist.</p>
					<p>Too bad it's <em>too new</em> to use. If you're <a
					href="https://caniuse.com/css-cascade-layers">using less
					than version ~100 of your respective browser</a>, you'd be
					out of luck and (likely) get wacky results. Hopefully things
					get sorted out soon.</p>

				<section class="article-content e-content">
                    <p>So, I'm going on a little trip with my
                    family. It's going to be a long airline ride, and
                    probably more driving on top of that. So, in order
                    to help with duration, and to help cut down on the
                    screen time, I've started looking, again, into
                    print and play games.</p>
                    <p>I've done this once before, during the pandemic (well,
                    it's <em>still</em> the pandemic, but 2 years on
                    already&hellip;). I printed
					<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163310/supermarche">
						Supermarche
					</a>,
                    <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197097/four-against-darkness">
						Four Against Darkness
					</a> (bought),
					<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255360/bargain-basement-bathysphere">
						Bargan Basement Bathyspheres (of Beachside Bay)
					</a>, and
					<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75223/utopia-engine">
						Utopia Engine
					</a>. Many of these I just sent to Kinkos/FedEx/Whatever to
					get printed on nice stock or lamenated for multiple plays.
					This time, I've chosen a few new ones.</p>
					<p>I was really tempted to print
					<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/340909/gloomholdin">
						Gloomholdin'
					</a>,
					but I tend not to be in the mood to play something complex
					in a confined space. I'd rather spread out and enjoy a
					complex experience. Travel also makes complex things
					frustrating. I don't think anyone is going to want to be any
					more frustrated than they will be. To that end, I've sent
					~$17 worth of printing on nice cardstock to FedEx:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183571/deep-space-d-6">Deep Space D6</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199242/mini-rogue-9-card-print-and-play-game">Mini Rouge</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Both have simple rules and simple materials. Mini Rouge
                    can be co-op, and both are small enough to comfortably sit
                    inside a backpack or pastic bag. Of course, I'll be taking
                    dice, some meeple and a tray, too.</p>

					<p>I <em>love</em> Emacs. I really do. I use for lots of
					things. <em>However</em>, I absolutely love using VSCode for
					web stuff, and Python. It <em>feels</em> like there is a
					more comfortable setup configured for these languages than
					in Emacs. I imagine I <em>could</em> make Emacs work better,
					but at what time cost to me?</p>
					<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thinking about this,
					Emacs feels like an all-or-nothing affair. When
					you use Emacs, you're
					practically <em>encouraged</em> to use it for
					everything. I mean, why leave if you can access
					all or most of your tools from within Emacs? Need
					to kill a process? <kbd>M-x proced</kbd>. Need to
					read some email? <kbd>M-x mail</kbd> (or one of
					the many variants). Need a terminal? <kbd>M-x
					eshell</kbd>. Even things like organization,
					calendaring, note taking and chat can all be
					done <em>inside</em> Emacs. It becomes an integral
					part of your life, except when you can't use
					it. Which means while on the go you're stuck
					without your second brain. One of the biggest
					reasons I kind of stopped using it was due to
					this. Even as I type these words into Emacs, I
					know that it doesn't <em>quite</em> fit for
					me. Which is sad, because I like it so much.</p>

					<p>Woof, Impostor Syndrome. Story of my life.</p>
					<p>I spent nearly ten years working on websites and doing
					"coding" (for whatever values of that you're willing to

					PHP</abbr>). This was a position I inherited
					because I had tinkered with it as a kid and had an affinity

						<li>A systems engineer</li>

					<p>I have an expertise in doing desktop support. That's
					pretty much it. Everything else is just me learning enough
					to be, as Kev puts: "dangerous". I sometimes think that
					everyone behaves this way, and no one is a expert. However,
					that is clearly not the case. People may not know every

					<p>I've been one to throw myself into awkward
						computing situations. Frequently, I install new
						updates and explore features that are barely
						tested. In short: I don't shy away from "new". Even if
						it's a big change. I spent more than a year booting
						from a floppy to load BeOS when even <em>Firefox</em>
						was barely working on it. I've toyed around with
						different Linux window managers, including ones like
						DWM which require you to know some C to configure it,
						compiling it after each change. Hell, I used Emacs and
						Notmuch mail with <em>POP3</em> in 2021
						on <em>Exchange</em> because I thought it'd be
						neat.</p>
					<p>I don't know why, then, that Windows 11 rubs me
						so <em>wrong</em>.</p>
					<p>It's not like the interface has changed so
						dramatically that I can't work anymore. I feel like
						it's a death from a thousand small cuts. From menu
						items appearing cramped and odd looking. To the total
						revamp of the Settings application and how nothing
						works right. 11 should have been Microsoft's time to
						absolutely blow people away with the runaway success
						of 10. My first login experience was multiple messages
						about some Teams DLLs not being correct for my
						platform. Again, I shouldn't be bothered by any of
						this, but I am.</p>

					<p>I'm also really bothered because I feel like the
						Windows 10 install on my old potato computer is as
						good as it can get. Upgrading to 11 on a newer laptop
						feels like it would be a wash, both in productivity
						and in functionality. I mean, I plan on upgrading
						at <em>some point</em>. I just don't know when. This
						makes me strongly reconsider Linux, though I'm not in
						love with that idea, either.</p>

					<p>What an absolute tool. I don't even know why I bother with
						anything Aral has to say. He's such a blowhard, spinning up
						projects that he has no intention of finishing, or even
						supporting when he's bored of it. I guess this is a "shame on
						me" moment.</p>
					<p><a href="https://ar.al/2018/08/27/better-blocker-two-year-review-and-thoughts-on-the-future/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Not 3 years ago, Aral was talking
							about how their iOS ad-blocking app "Better Blocker" was doing
							middlingly well</a>, but gave them a decent chunk of change a
						year (more than some make doing <em>actual jobs</em>). Now,
						because Apple didn't fight doing searches for child pornography
						on people's photos, they've taken it down.</p>
					<p>Mind you, Better Blocker was a <em>paid</em> appliction. One
						that required only maintenance to stay in line with the app
						store rules and to throw up block list updates on some external
						server. Not exactly rocket science. When they took down their
						app, they didn't even bother to tell paid users. It just stops
						updating. The app page is unavailable and there is nothing but a
						blog post on his personal site about it. Wonderful.</p>
					<p>What a pretentious douchebag. If you want to steer clear of
						non-profits doing more harm than good, then stay away from the
						so-called "Small Technology Foundation". Nothing good comes from
						either of these two grifters using the guise of non-profit to
						live a privleged life..</p>

					<p>Sometimes I find it hard to write about <em>anything</em>
						here. Not because I don't have something to say. If my posting
						history on Fosstodon was any indication, I had a hard time
						shutting up. I just have a hard time coming up with things to
						talk about <em>at length</em>.</p>
					<p>For instance, I've been playing Downfall, a Slay the Spire
						mod which lets you play as the bosses. I've been picking back up
						Marvel Champions now that the spider-verse expansion is out.
						I've also been hand-wringing, trying to decide if I want to get
						a new laptop or not spend that kind of money on, essentially, a
						gaming platform that does other utility things. I've also been
						massively busy with school and work because it's getting toward
						the end of semester, and the board of directors meetings are
						going on.</p>
					<p>I'm awfully tired. I'm pretty tired of this dumb diet my
						trainer has me on, and I'm also tired of feeling like every day
						is the same set of tasks, with little to differentiate between
						them. I take all this with a grain of salt, though, because I'm
						going to Alaska soon-ish.</p>
					<p>I kind of see why there is a growing trend of people doing
						"monthly summary" posts to fill in those odd gaps of all the
						things that aren't important enough to warrant a full post. I
						guess that's something to consider.</p>

					<p>Once upon a time, I watched a movie/documentary called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi">"Jiro
							Dreams of Sushi"</a>, a delightful film about this master sushi
						chef that has a small, but extremely exclusive sushi resturant
						in the bottom of a Tokyo office building. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Ono_(chef)">Jiro</a>,
						the titular character, is a man driven by the desire to perfect
						his sushi and delight his patrons. Spoilers: He does so.</p>
					<p>Jiro's sushi is served in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakase">omakase</a>,
						translated as "I'll leave it up to you [the chef]". You don't
						order food like you would at a traditional resturant. You come
						in, sit down and are fed what the chef has in mind for the
						night. Sometimes this is pre-set for a particular season,
						sometimes it changes on the chef's whim or availability of
						ingredients. Regardless, it's a very facinating experience.</p>
					<p>That all being said, <a href="https://www.norikase.com/">my
							wife recently discovered that there is an omakase-style
							resturant in town</a> that is just sort of getting started. It's
						got a small, ten-person seating for the omakase event and she
						got us seats for our anniversary. What a delight it was. I've
						never had sushi like this, nor have I had any sushi that
						compares.</p>

					<p>Seventeen courses. That seems like a lot, thinking about it.
						However, you're eating your meal roughly one bite at a time, so
						it doesn't feel overwhelming. You also get the "show" of seeing
						sushi chefs do what they do best. Hyper-sharp knife skills,
						picky about fish choices and attention to the smallest
						details. It's art.</p>

					<p>It feels weird to say it, but hover events (mouse style) are
						becoming old fashioned selectors on the web. That's not to say
						that there aren't <em>plenty</em> of users using mouse and
						keyboard on the web. It's just that there are probably <em>many
							more</em> on their phones or tablets, browsing your site. These
						users don't have any standard method of triggering these
						events.</p>
					<p>Just eariler today, I was working on some CSS on my site,
						when I noticed that the hover events don't work well with touch
						screens. I understand <em>why</em>, but the workarounds&hellip;
						don't spark joy. <a href="https://git.degruchy.link/ndegruchy/degruchy-org/src/commit/4a7f1d74882727e87574e08476941144636496d2/index.html#L800">One
							I found</a>, a is just a sort of open-ended loaded the
						<code>touchstart</code> event and things ✨ magically ✨
						worked.
					</p>
					<p>I'm pretty sure that we're not far off from a future where
						hover events are a legacy thing that gets added to tick a box. I
						hope I'm wrong, maybe screens will get a near-touch hover event.
						Who knows...</p>
					<p>For anyone looking to be pendantic, like me, you can wrap
						your <code>:hover</code> psuedo-selectors in a <code>@media
				screen and (hover: hover)</code> to gate the effects behind a
						feature lookup. <b>Note:</b> this appears to be hit-or miss as
						mobile browsers will sometimes fire hover events on hover-esque
						touches. So, <abbr title="Your Milage May Vary">YMMV</abbr>.</p>

					<p>I don't care much for OneNote as a note-taking tool. It works
						alright, but it's slow and often feels sloppy and disorganized.
						I much prefer plain text. It's universal and note prone to
						corruption like the former. So, then why is it so hard to have
						everywhere?</p>
					<h3>Bear</h3>
					<p>What a beautiful app. Too bad it's probably the worst. Not
						only do you pay $1.49/mo. for sync on it's own systems, but you
						don't even get web access for non-Apple platforms. No choice of
						sync to preferred services.</p>
					<h3 id="emacs">Emacs</h3>
					<p>Ah, yes, my favorite editor. Not really something that you
						would call a &quot;markdown&quot; editor, specifically. However,
						it <em>does</em> edit Markdown, and it can save to any location
						the device has access to, including OneDrive or iCloud. There is
						just one problem: No iOS. Not surprising, really, but it makes
						it a shitty cross-platform tool for taking notes.</p>
					<h3 id="byline">Byline</h3>
					<p>Another iOS, Markdown-focused editor. Saves to a number of
						locations, just not OneDrive, not even through the files app.
						While you can <em>access</em> already created notes on it, you
						can&#39;t start them there.</p>
					<h3 id="ios-notes">iOS Notes</h3>
					<p>It saves notes in Exchange Online (or iCloud) and syncs with
						Outlook and kind of OneNote, but not really. Also, very limited
						if you&#39;re not using iCloud as the back-end.</p>
					<h3 id="onenote">OneNote</h3>
					<p>Has decent enough applications for Windows, macOS and iOS
						(and Android), syncs with OneDrive and has connections to notes
						in Exchange Online. Has lots of features and whatnot. It&#39;s
						just slow, clunky and unintuitive and messy and... bleh.</p>
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>Is OneNote really the only answer? 😞</p>

					<p>There are a lot of ways to automate things. PHP has,

					</p>
					<p>So seductive is this ability to make content appear in HTML
						that even stupidly trivial things, like this page, whisper their
						almost silent promises of making it <em>so much</em> easier to
						write and publish on it. Thankfully, this has already been done
						to death by a dearth of links to abandoned PHP projects smeared
						across the gleaming black and white surface of GitHub's project
						listings pages.</p>
					<p>Would I like to make this whole process easier? <em>Of course
							I would.</em> That's not the point, though.</p>

					<p>I'm not above a certain level of irony and dissonance. I
						<em>know</em> that VSCode is basically a hyper-fancy webpage for

								F.O.M.O. or "The Fear of Missing Out"
							</a>

						<dd>
							Fear of missing out (FOMO) is the feeling of
							apprehension that one is either not in the know or
							missing out on information, events, experiences, or life
							decisions that could make one's life better. FOMO is
							also associated with a fear of regret, which may lead
							to concerns that one might miss an opportunity for
							social interaction, a novel experience, a memorable
							event, or a profitable investment.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<p><a href="#20220309-antisocial">I have a problem with Social
							Media.</a> It stems from my underlying depression. With social
						media, I can create a persona that is similar to me, but is
						designed to be a much more symapathetic overview. To what end?
						More interaction.</p>
					<p>The more replies, likes, boosts and other buttons, the more
						my head gets a tiny little dopamine kick. String those along for
						enough time and it becomes habit. The problem with this, though,
						is that while dopamine is all well and good. It doesn't keep you
						coming back. That's where FOMO comes into play.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>"A challenge is that the part of our brain that
							reinforces behaviors is stimulated by novelty; social media
							scrolling always promises something new with the next
							scroll."</p>
						<cite>Dr. Michael Jaffee, director of the Neurology Sleep
							Clinic at the University of Florida</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Forget drugs! Scrolling Reddit, Twitter or Mastodon allows
						you to get that "just <em>one</em> more" satisfaction.
						Infinitely. That makes it not only hard to quit, full stop, but
						also hard to just put down.</p>
					<p>For me, it wasn't something I could handle responsibly. I
						tried, like the author, to do things like:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>While app developers want to keep you engaged for as long
							as possible, most of them do offer tools to limit screen
							use. So I did what I don't think (anecdotally) many people
							do — I set up time limits on my social media apps like
							Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to help manage my screen use
							before bed with the hopes of getting more sleep.</p>
						<p>&hellip;</p>
						<p>Sometimes it worked and I would surrender my phone to my
							bedside table, irritated but also appreciative of the sweet
							relief of darkness on my eyes. But other times I would plug
							in the passcode, ignoring the tinge of regret that pinched
							my stomach and knowledge that my future self would be angry
							— and tired — in the morning.</p>
						<cite>Katie Camero, BuzzFeed News Reporter</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Only to ignore the rules I had set for myself and just plow
						on, unhindered. It was really surreal the first few times, and
						pretty much automatic by the time I had my blow up. For me, the
						problem wasn't lack of sleep. It was the crumbling relationships
						I had ignored for too long. Worse than being tired or cranky, I
						had to deal with real human issues around my additction. I still
						do.</p>
					<p>I feel it still. The need to post pithy little comments.
						Engage in conversation and insider's humor. Every time, though,
						I need to understand that it's not <em>that</em> important.
						Especially it's not important enough to interrupt family time,
						or other important events, where I should be present.</p>
					<p>To that end, I am seeking professional help for my addiction.
						I know I need help, and now I'm going to get it. Maybe one day
						I'll be in control enough to re-engage with social media, but my
						suspicion is that I am going to have to treat this like
						Alcoholism and just abstain.</p>

					<p>I've been using social media a <em>lot</em>. My drug of
						choice is the federated system known as Mastodon. It's an
						ad-free, user supported system of services that have no one
						central point of control or failure. This means you can chat
						with all kinds of people on all kinds of wacky subjects.</p>
					<p>That's kind of the problem.</p>
					<p>I've been using it as a substitute for my own life. I've used
						it in ways that have hurt others, but mostly I've used it for
						the minimal dopamine kick that you get when someone does &hellip;
						whatever, respond, like &hellip; etc. Small kicks frequently enough
						over time make you feel good, in control and liked. Regardless
						of the actual state of things.</p>
					<p>Destroying my life for a dopamine kick isn't exactly
						sustainable. Hence, my abstinence.</p>
					<p>To help fill that void, I've decided that I want to journal
						more. I got a book and a pen and I've been writing. I also have
						this blog to help me with that. Despite my misgivings around
						WordPress, I've tabled them until I can get my head and life
						straightened out.</p>
					<p>I'm going to take this opportunity to take a good hard look
						at myself and what I get out of the tools and systems I use. I
						want to be enriched by things, not dragged into small highs that
						I seek more and more of to the detriment of everything else.</p>
					<p>So, if you're looking for me. I'm here, just not there.</p>

					<p>I used to like WordPress. Back when it was just a naicent
						blogging platform with spaghetti code PHP and an friendly
						interface.</p>
					<p>However, it's turned into a monster. A monster that wants to
						be everything to everyone without actually fixing anything. This
						feels dangerous, as it doesn't feel like anything substantial is
						being done to help ensure that the codebase is more organized or
						easier to interface with. Instead they add features, like
						Gutenberg, and press the "advantages" of "Full Site Editing".
						Throwing the theme world on it's head, pushing more and more
						features into JavaScript instead of using the proper tooling
						already installed on the server. They push more WooCommerce
						plugins and online store updates to monitize and drive
						"engagement" and "click throughs" and "sales".</p>
					<p>I want the <em>old</em> WordPress back. The one that was
						designed to be a blogging platform. It filled a niche that was
						needed, and left the more generic Content Management to the
						heavy-hitters like Joomla and Drupal. You can see the fragments
						of the fevered development in where they put things in the
						database. Tables once only intending to hold one type of content
						now layer lots of different options and configurations in a
						haphazard manner. Things like theme customizations appearing in
						the post content tables along side block customizations. Term
						tables house post content information. It's chaos.</p>
					<p>So, for now, I'm back to hand-editing this content, in a text
						editor and uploading it to my server and serving it statically.
						No content management system like Hugo, no PHP or Laravel or
						Node.js. Just me, an editor and a bit of time. I'm sure a time
						will come where I migrate to (or back to) something. Right now,
						I'm just enjoying the feeling.</p>
